<h3>
THE OWNER OF THE PATRIARCH
</h3>

<p>
If any one cares to look up the <i>Patriarch</i> in
Lloyd's List, it will be discovered that the line
given to her reads thus:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-001"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-001.jpg" alt="Patriarch's ship record" />
</p>

<p>
And all these hieroglyphics mean something
to the initiated, of whom, as a matter of fact,
there are more ashore than at sea.  But the
main point is that the owner of her was
T. Tyser, and it matters very little whether
she was built of heavier plating than the rules
required, or whether she was cemented, or
built under special survey, or what not.  For
T. Tyser, otherwise Mr. Thomas Tyser, was
not only the owner of the <i>Patriarch</i>, but also
the owner of a dozen other vessels all beginning
with a P.  He was, moreover, the owner of a
large block of land in the heart of Melbourne;
he had several streets, of which the biggest
was Tyser Street, S.E., in London, and his
banking account was certainly of heavier metal
than he had any personal use for.  He was a
rough dog from the north country, and in the
course of half a century's fight in London he
came out top-dog in his own line, and was more
or less of a millionaire.
</p>

<p>
'And he's my uncle,' said Geordie Potts;
'his sister was my mother, and here I am
before the stick in one of his old wind-jammers,
and gettin' two-pun-ten in this here <i>Patriarch</i>
of his, and hang me if I believe the old
bloke has another relative in the world.  It's
hard lines, mates, it's hard lines.  Don't you
allow it's hard lines?'
</p>

<p>
It was Sunday morning in the South-East
Trades, and every sail was drawing, 'like a
bally droring-master,' as Geordie once said,
and the 'crowds' of the <i>Patriarch</i> were all
fairly easy in their minds and ready for a
discussion.
</p>

<p>
'<i>If</i> so be you are 'is nevvy, as you state,'
said the port watch cautiously, 'we allows it's
'ard lines.'
</p>

<p>
'I've stated it frequent,' said Geordie, 'and
it's the truth, the whole truth, and nothin'
but it, so help me.  D'ye think I'd claim to
be old Tyser's sister's son if I wasn't?  I'd
scorn to claim it.'
</p>

<p>
'Any man would scorn to be Tyser's sister's
son,' said the starboard watch; 'he'd scorn to
be 'im unless 'e was, for Tyser's a mean old
dog, ain't 'e, Geordie?'
</p>

<p>
Geordie thanked his watch-mates for backing
him up so.  'That's right, chaps.  There 's
no meaner in the north of England, or the
south for that matter, and the way this ship's
found is scandalous.'
</p>

<p>
'The grub's horrid,' said both watches.
</p>

<p>
'And look at the gear,' said Geordie;
'everything ready to part a deal easier than my
uncle is.  I never lays hold of a halliard but
I'm thinking I'll go on my back if I pulls
heavy.  Oh, he's a fair scandal!'
</p>

<p>
He considered the scandal soberly, and with
some sadness.
</p>

<p>
'He might leave you some dibs, Geordie,'
suggested his mate, Jack Braby; 'he might,
after all.'
</p>

<p>
'Not a solitary dime,' said Geordie; 'him
and me quarrelled because my father fought
him in the street, and I hit the old hunks
with a bit of a brick because he got my dad
down.'
</p>

<p>
'Wot was the row about?' asked the others
eagerly.
</p>

<p>
'Nothin' to speak of,' said George; 'my
old man said he was a blood-sucker, and that
led to words.  And I never hurt him to speak
of.  And yet I've shipped in one of his ships,
and am as poor as he's rich.  He allowed none
of us would get a farthing: he shouted it out
in the market-place, and said hospitals would
get it, because, when one of his skippers that
he'd sacked cut him up awful with a stay-sail
hank, they sewed him up very neat at one
of 'em.'
</p>

<p>
'There's nothin' so good in a fight as a
stay-sail 'ank,' said Jack Braby, contemplatively.
'I cut a polisman all to rags wiv one once.'
</p>

<p>
'Was that the time you done three months'
'ard?' asked the port watch.
</p>

<p>
'Six,' said Braby proudly, 'and I told the
beak I could do it on my 'ead.  But, Geordie,
if you was owner yourself what would you
do?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, wot?' asked the rest.
</p>

<p>
Geordie shook his head and sighed.
</p>

<p>
'I'd make my ships such that sailormen
would be wanting to pay to go in 'em,' said
Geordie.  'I've laid awake thinkin' of it.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, tell us,' said all hands, with as much
unanimity as if they were tailing on to the
halliards under the stimulus of 'Give us some
time to blow the man down!'  'Tell us,
Geordie.'
</p>

<p>
'I'd be friends with all my men for one
thing,' said Geordie, 'and I'd not have a
single Dutchman in a ship of mine.'
</p>

<p>
The three 'Dutchmen' on board&mdash;one of
whom was a Swede, another a German, and
the third a Finn&mdash;shifted uneasily on their
chests, but said nothing.
</p>

<p>
'And not a Dago,' continued the 'owner,'
'and I'd give double wages, and grog three
times a day, and tobacco throwed in.  And the
cook shouldn't be a hash-spoiler but what
Frenchies calls a chef.'
</p>

<p>
'We never heard of that.  How d'ye spell
it, Geordie?'
</p>

<p>
'S, h, e, double f,' said Geordie; 'and it
means a man that is known not to spoil vittles,
as most sea-cooks does, by the very look of
him.  And when it was wet or cold the galley
fire should be alight all night.  And the skipper
and the mates should be told by me, and told
very stern, that if they vallied their billets a
continental they'd behave like gents and not
cuss too much.  And there shouldn't be no
working up, and any officer of mine that
was dead on dry pulls on the halliards should
have the sack quick.  And every time a
ship of mine came into dock I'd be there,
and I'd see what the crowds' opinion was of
the skipper and the mates.  Oh, I'd make my
ships a paradise, I would!'
</p>

<p>
Most of the men nodded approval, but Braby
wasn't quite satisfied.
</p>

<p>
'And would there be grog every time of
shortenin' sail, Geordie?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, of course,' said George, 'and every
time you made sail too.'
</p>

<p>
But an old seaman shook his head.
</p>

<p>
''Tis mighty fine, mates, to 'ear Geordie guff
as to what 'e'd do,' he growled, 'but I ain't
young, and I've seed men get rich and they
wasn't in the least what they allowed they'd
be.  Geordie 'ere is one of hus now, and 'e
feels where the shoe pinches, but if so be
'e got rotten with money 'e'd be for callin'
sailormen swine as like as not.  And 'e'd wear
a topper.'
</p>

<p>
'You're a liar, I wouldn't,' roared Geordie.
</p>

<p>
'Maybe I am a liar,' said the old chap, 'but
I've seen what I've looked at.  If you was to
learn as your huncle was dead now, you'd go
aft and set about on the poop and see hus
doin' pulley-hauley, with a seegar in your teeth.
Riches spoils a man, and it can't be helped: it
'as to, somehow.  I've no fault to find with you
now, Geordie Potts; for so young a man you're
a good seaman and a good shipmate (though
you 'ave called me a liar), but, you take my
word for it, money would make an 'og of you.'
</p>

<p>
And here was matter for high debate, which
lasted all through the Trades, through the
Horse Latitudes, and into the region of the
brave west winds, till the <i>Patriarch</i> had made
more than half her easting.
</p>

<p>
'So I'm to be a mean swab, and a real swine,
when I'm rich,' said Geordie.  'Eh, well, have
it your own way.  There's times some of you
makes me feel I'd like to make you sit up.'
</p>

<p>
''Ear, 'ear,' said the old fo'c'sleman, 'there's
the very thought of 'aughty richness workin' in
'is mind, shipmates.  What'll the real thing
do if 'is huncle pegs out sudden?'
</p>

<p>
It was curious to note that a certain subdued
hostility rose up between most of the men and
Geordie.  They sat apart and discussed him.
Even Jack Braby threw out dark and melancholy
hints that they wouldn't be chums any
more if old Tyser's money came to his nephew.
There were at times faint suggestions that
Geordie was getting touched with his possible
prosperity.
</p>

<p>
'I'll live ashore and have a public-house,'
said Geordie Potts.
</p>

<p>
And they picked up Cape Otway light in due
time, and ran through Port Phillip Heads by
and by, and came to an anchor off Sandridge.
Presently they berthed alongside the pier, and
began to discharge their cargo; and one hot
day went by like another till they were empty
and began to fill up again with wool.  In six
weeks they were almost ready for sea once
more.  And the very night before they hauled
out from their berth and lay at anchor in the
bay, Geordie went ashore at six o'clock 'all
by his lonesome,' as he and Jack Braby had
fought over the job which Braby was to get
from his mate when old Tyser died intestate.
And as he got to the end of the pier he met
a young clerk from the agents' office who knew
him by sight.
</p>

<p>
'I say, I'm in a great hurry,' said the boy,
'my girl's waiting for me.  Will you take
these letters to Captain Smith, or I'll miss my
train back?  I'll give you a bob.'
</p>

<p>
'Right oh!' said Geordie, and he pouched the
shilling and the letters, and the young fellow
ran for his train.
</p>

<p>
'The letters can wait,' said Geordie Potts,
'but the bob can't, and I've five more besides.
Jack might have had his whack out of it if
he hadn't wanted to be my manager, when he
ain't fit for it.'
</p>

<p>
He put the letters into his pocket and made
his way to the Sandridge Arms, where he sat
and drank by himself.  It was seven o'clock,
and he was by then tolerably 'full,' before it
occurred to him to see if he still had the
letters.  He took them out, and the very first
his eyes lighted on was one in a long envelope
addressed to
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  George Potts, Esq.,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c/o Captain Smith,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Patriarch</i>.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'Blimy,' said Geordie, 'this can't be me!
Esq. is what they puts after names of gents.
Even the skipper don't have it after his.'
</p>

<p>
He fingered the long envelope and took
another drink to consider the matter on.
</p>

<p>
'Holy Sailor, it must be me!' he said as
he drew confidence out of his glass, 'there's
no other Potts but me.'
</p>

<p>
He was over-full by now, and he opened the
letter and began to read it.
</p>

<p>
'My dear Sir&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'By the holy frost,' said Geordie, 'me My
dear Sir!'
</p>

<p>
He went on reading.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'MY DEAR SIR,&mdash;We regret to inform you
of the sudden death of your uncle,
Mr. Thomas Tyser, on the 10th inst.  He left no
will, and you, as the next of kin and the
heir-at-law, are entitled to all his real and personal
estate, which is, as you are doubtless aware,
very large.  According to our present estimate
it will amount to at least half a million sterling,
and as we have been his legal advisers for the
last twenty years, and know all his affairs,
we can assure you that, with proper management
of certain undertakings at present in our
hands, it may be much more than our estimate.
In order that you may return at once, we
enclose you a draft on the Union Bank of
Australia for £200, and have instructed Captain
Smith to give you your discharge, which he
will of course do at once.
</p>

<p>
'We hope, as we have been so long in
the confidence of Mr. Tyser, that you will
see no reason to complain of our care
for your interests.&mdash;We are, my dear Sir,
your obedient servants,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
THOMAS WIGGS &amp; Co.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'Holy Sailor!' said Geordie.  And he stared
aghast at a square piece of paper which he
had reason to believe represented £200.  'Holy
Sailor, what a pot o' money!'  He gasped,
and took another drink.
</p>

<p>
'I'm the owner of the <i>Patriarch</i>,' he said,
and grasping all the letters and his £200
draft he rammed them down into the bottom
of his inside breast-pocket.  'I'm the owner
of&mdash;hic&mdash;the&mdash;hic&mdash;<i>Patriarch</i>.'
</p>

<p>
He came out of his corner and went to the bar.
</p>

<p>
'Gimme a drink, an expensive drink, one
that'll cost five bob,' he demanded of the
barman.
</p>

<p>
'You'd better have a bottle o' brandy,' said
the barman.
</p>

<p>
'I wants the best.'
</p>

<p>
'This is Hennessy's forty-star brandy,' said
the liar behind the bar.  'There's no better
in the world.'
</p>

<p>
And Geordie retreated with the bottle to his
corner, and took a long drink of a poisonous
compound which contained as much insanity
in it as a small lunatic asylum.  He came
back to the bar presently, and told the barman
that he was a millionaire.
</p>

<p>
'I own half Newcastle and a lot of Bourke
Street, Melbourne, and a baker's dozen of ships,
and lumps of London!' said Geordie.
</p>

<p>
'Lend me a thousand pounds till to-morrow,'
said the barman.
</p>

<p>
'I like you&mdash;hic&mdash;I'll do it,' said Geordie;
and with that he fell headlong and forgot his
wealth.  They dragged him outside on the
verandah, and let him lie in the cool of the
evening.  He was picked up there two hours
later by Jack Braby and some of the starboard
watch, and taken on board.
</p>

<p>
'He let on he was a millionaire,' said the
barman contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
Braby shook his head.
</p>

<p>
'Ah, he's liable to allow that when he's
full, sir,' said Braby.
</p>

<p>
But that fatal bottle kept Geordie Potts
wholly insensible till they were outside the
Heads again and on their way to England
with the smoke of the tugboat far astern.  And
presently the second mate, Mr. Brose, who
was a very rough sort of dog and had sweated
his way up to his present exalted rank from
that of a fore-mast hand, hauled Geordie out
by the collar of his coat and had him brought
to by means of a bucketful of nice Bass's
Strait water.  Geordie gasped like a dying
dolphin, but came to rapidly.
</p>

<p>
'I'll teach you to get drunk, you swab,'
said Brose.  'Take those wet things off and
turn to.'
</p>

<p>
And Geordie obeyed like a child in the
presence of <i>force majeure</i>.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Lord, I've a head,' he told his mates,
'and it seems to me that I had a most
extro'r'nary dream.'
</p>

<p>
'Wot did you dream of, old Cocklywax?'
asked Braby, 'did you dream you'd come in
for old Tyser's money?'
</p>

<p>
And Geordie gasped.
</p>

<p>
'S'elp me,' he murmured, 's'elp me, did I dream?'
</p>

<p>
He dropped his marlinspike as if it were
red-hot, and made a break for the fo'c'sle and
his wet coat.
</p>

<p>
'Now if so be I dreamed,' he said, 'there'll
be nought in this pocket.  And if I didn't, I'm jiggered.'
</p>

<p>
He put his hand in and brought out a
handful of damp and crushed letters, and came
out upon deck staggering.  Mr. Brose saw
him, and was in his tracks like a fish-hawk
on a herring-gull.  Geordie saw him coming,
and stood open-mouthed.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, sir,' said Geordie, 'oh, sir&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, blazes,' said Brose, 'what's your
damned shenanakin' game?  Get to work,
or I'll have you soused till you're half-dead.'
</p>

<p>
But Geordie could explain nothing.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, sir,' he stammered, and held up his
papers, shaking them feebly.  And Brose shook
him, anything but feebly, so that Geordie's
teeth chattered.
</p>

<p>
'If you please, sir,' he cried out at last, 'if
you please, sir, don't.  I owns her.'
</p>

<p>
'You owns wot?' demanded Brose.  And
the rest of the men edged as near as they
dared.
</p>

<p>
'He's drunk still,' said Braby, as Brose
shook his mate once more.
</p>

<p>
'I owns the bally <i>Patriarch</i>,' screamed
Geordie, 'and all the rest of 'em, and all my
uncle's richness; and I won't be shook, I
won't!'
</p>

<p>
And Brose let him go.
</p>

<p>
'You're mad,' said Brose, 'you're mad.'
</p>

<p>
'I ain't,' roared Geordie, who was fast
recovering from the shock.  'I ain't.  Take
these, read 'em, read 'em out.  Let the skipper
read 'em.  I owns the <i>Patriarch</i>, and the
<i>Palermo</i>, and the <i>Proosian</i>, and the whole line.
The lawyers says so!'
</p>

<p>
He put the lot of damp letters into Mr. Brose's
hands, and sat down on the spare top-mast
lashed under the rail.
</p>

<p>
'There's letters for the captain 'ere,' said
Brose suspiciously.  ''Ow did you get 'em?'
</p>

<p>
''Twas a youngster from the office gave 'em
me,' replied Geordie, 'and I took a drink first
and there was one for me, and it said so, said
I was the owner, said it plain.'
</p>

<p>
And when Brose had read the opened letter
he gasped too, and went aft to see the skipper.
The rest of the watch gathered round Geordie,
and spoke in awestruck whispers.
</p>

<p>
'Is it true, Geordie?'
</p>

<p>
'Gospel,' said Geordie, 'it's swore to.  They
sends me two hundred quid in a paper.'
</p>

<p>
'Show us,' said the starbowlines, 'show us.'
</p>

<p>
'It's in the paper the second greaser has,'
said Geordie, 'it's wrote "Pay George Potts,
Esq., two hundred quid on the nail."'
</p>

<p>
'I'd never 'ave let Brose 'ave it,' said Braby,
'like as not 'e'll keep it.'
</p>

<p>
'Then I'll sack him,' said Geordie firmly.
'Let him dare try to keep it, and I'll sack him
and not pay him no wages."
</p>

<p>
'This is a very strange game, this is,' said
Braby.  'I never 'eard tell of the likes.  Did
they put "Esk" on your letter?'
</p>

<p>
'They done so,' said Geordie.  'I've seen
uncle's letters, and they done so to him.'
</p>

<p>
'Then it must be true,' said Braby; 'they
on'y puts "Esk" on gents' letters.'
</p>

<p>
And Williams the steward was observed
coming for'ard scratching his head.
</p>

<p>
'Where the 'ell am I?' asked Williams,
'and wot's the game?  I'm sent by the
captain to say will "Mr." Potts step into the
cabin.'
</p>

<p>
They all looked at Geordie.
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Potts&mdash;why, that's you, Geordie.'
</p>

<p>
'I s'pose it must be,' said the owner.  'Must
I go, mates?'
</p>

<p>
'Of course,' cried Braby.
</p>

<p>
But Geordie fidgeted.
</p>

<p>
'I could go in if we was painting of her
cabin,' he murmured, 'but to talk with the
skipper&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
That evidently disgruntled him.
</p>

<p>
''Tis your own cabin any'ow,' said Braby.
'I'd walk in like a lord.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, I s'pose I must,' said Geordie
reluctantly, and he went aft with Williams.
</p>

<p>
'And you're the owner?' asked Williams.
</p>

<p>
Geordie sighed.
</p>

<p>
'So it seems, stoo'ard,' he admitted.
</p>

<p>
'It beats the devil,' said Williams.
</p>

<p>
'So it does,' said Geordie, and the next
moment he found himself announced as
Mr. Potts, and he stood before the captain with
his cap in his hand, looking as if he was about
to be put in irons for mutiny.  But as a matter
of fact, the old skipper was a deal more nervous
than he was.
</p>

<p>
'This seems all correct, Mr. Potts,' said
Smith.
</p>

<p>
'Does it, sir?' asked Geordie, 'I'm very
sorry, sir; but it ain't my fault, sir.  I never
meant&mdash;at least, I never allowed my uncle
would do it, because my father, sir, said he
was a blood-sucker, and they fought and I
hit uncle with a brick, sir, to make him let
go of father's beard.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah, yes, to be sure,' said the captain
nervously, 'but I'm thinking what to do.  It's
a very anomalous situation for you to be here,
Potts&mdash;Mr. Potts, I mean.'
</p>

<p>
But Geordie held up his hand.
</p>

<p>
'I'd <i>much</i> rather be Potts, sir, thanking you
all the same.'
</p>

<p>
'I couldn't do it,' replied the skipper.  'I
was thinking that you might like me to put
back to Melbourne?'
</p>

<p>
'Wot for, sir?' demanded the owner.
</p>

<p>
'So that you could go home in a P. &amp; O. boat,'
said old Smith.
</p>

<p>
'Thanking you kindly, sir,' replied Geordie,
'I'd rather stay in the <i>Patriarch</i>.  I don't like
steamers, and never did.'
</p>

<p>
He had a vague notion that the skipper
wanted him to go home before the mast in one.
</p>

<p>
'Then you wish me not to put back,
Mr. Potts?' said Smith.
</p>

<p>
'I'd very much rather not, sir,' replied
Geordie.  'I'm very happy here, sir, and
takin' it all round, the <i>Patriarch's</i> a comfortable
ship, sir.  May I go for'ard now, sir?'
</p>

<p>
He made a step for the cabin door.
</p>

<p>
'Oh dear, oh dear,' said old Smith, 'you
mustn't.  You must have a berth here, and
be a passenger.'
</p>

<p>
The skipper's obvious nervousness was not
without its effect upon the new owner.  For
old Smith knew that if he lost his present billet
he was not likely to find another one, and he
had nothing saved to speak of.  So somehow,
and without knowing why, Geordie, without
being in the least disrespectful, was more
decided in his answer than he would have been
if the 'old man' had showed himself as hard
and severe as usual.
</p>

<p>
'Not me,' said Geordie, 'not me, sir.  I
wouldn't, and I couldn't.  I'd be that
uncomfortable&mdash;oh, a passenger, good Lord, no!'
</p>

<p>
'But bein' owner, you can't stay for'ard,'
urged the skipper.
</p>

<p>
'Oh yes, I can, sir,' said Geordie, 'I'd
prefer it.'
</p>

<p>
Smith sighed.
</p>

<p>
'If you prefer it, of course you must.  But
if you change your mind, you'll let me know.'
</p>

<p>
'Right, I will&mdash;sir,' said Geordie.
</p>

<p>
The skipper walked with him to the cabin
door.
</p>

<p>
'And if you don't want to work, Mr. Potts,
I dare say we can get on without your services,
though we shall miss them,' he said anxiously.
</p>

<p>
'I couldn't lie about and do nix,' replied
Geordie, 'I'd die of it.'
</p>

<p>
And away he went for'ard, while the skipper
and Mr. Brose, and Mr. Ware, waked out of
his watch below to hear the extraordinary news,
discussed the situation.
</p>

<p>
'And 'ave I to call 'im Mr. Potts?' asked
Brose with a pathetic air of disgust.
</p>

<p>
'I say so,' replied the skipper, 'I can't afford,
Brose, as you know, to lose this job, and old
Tyser promised me a kind of marine superintendent's
billet when I left the <i>Patriarch</i>, and I
dessay this young chap will act decent about it.'
</p>

<p>
'I'm damned,' said Ware.  'I'm damned
and glad too that he ain't in my watch.  This
is hard lines on you, Mr. Brose.'
</p>

<p>
'If you please, Mr. Potts, will you be so
good has to be so kind has to be so hobliging
has to go and over'aul the gear on the main,'
piped Brose in furious mockery.  'Oh, this is
'ard!'
</p>

<p>
'Far from it,' said old Smith, 'you ought to
be proud.  It ain't every second mate has a
millionaire owner in his watch.'
</p>

<p>
But Brose was sullen.
</p>

<p>
'You mark me, this josser won't do no 'and's
turn that he don't like.'
</p>

<p>
And for'ard the crowd said the same.  As
a result, for at least ten days Geordie Potts
worked very well indeed.  But of course, Brose,
under the skipper's orders, gave him all the
soft jobs that were going.  The second mate
got into a mode of exaggerated courtesy which
was almost painful.
</p>

<p>
'Be so good, Mister Potts, as to put a nice
neat Matthew Walker on this 'ere laniard.'
</p>

<p>
Or&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Potts, please be kind enough to go
aloft and stop that spilling-line on the
fore-topsail-yard to the jackstay.'
</p>

<p>
And at meal-times the port watch mimicked
Brose.
</p>

<p>
'Dear Mr. Potts, howner, be so good as to
heat this 'orrid 'ash without growling.'
</p>

<p>
And presently when the weather began to
get cold and the men brought out their Cape
Horn P-jackets and their mitts, Geordie
commenced to growl a little.
</p>

<p>
'I hates turnin' out in the gravy-eye watch
worse and worse,' he said.  'I've half a mind
to let on I'm sick.'
</p>

<p>
'You'd better go haft and tell the "old man"
to 'ave the galley-fire kep' alight all night,'
said the crowd crossly.  'But you dasn't.'
</p>

<p>
'I dast,' said Geordie, 'why, I owns the bally
galley!'
</p>

<p>
'You dasn't!'
</p>

<p>
'I will,' said Geordie.  And next morning
he went aft and touched his cap to the skipper
and begged to be allowed to speak to him.
</p>

<p>
'The galley-fire at night!' said Smith.  'Oh,
certainly, Mr. Potts.  I never done it because
it was against the horders of your late revered
huncle, sir.'
</p>

<p>
'He was as mean as mean,' said Geordie.
'I think I can afford the fire, sir.'
</p>

<p>
The fire was lighted, and the crowd said
Geordie was the right sort.
</p>

<p>
'And wot about the gear, Mr. Howner?' asked
Jack Braby.  'If I was you, before it gets too
rotten cold, I'd have a real over'aulin' of things.'
</p>

<p>
'I'll think of it,' said Geordie.  And that
very afternoon he tackled Brose.
</p>

<p>
'The gear's tolerable rotten, sir,' he began.
And the second greaser knew he was right
and yet didn't like to say so.  He yearned to
curse him.
</p>

<p>
'And I'm thinkin',' said Geordie, 'it would
be a good thing to get up new stuff and overhaul
everything.  I risks my life every time I
goes aloft.  The very reef earings would part
if a school-girl yanked at 'em.'
</p>

<p>
'You'd better speak to Mr. Ware,' said
Brose, choking.
</p>

<p>
And at eight bells Geordie spoke to the chief
officer, who was quite as anxious as the skipper
to keep his billet.  'It shall be done, Mister
Potts,' said Ware.
</p>

<p>
In the first watch that night Geordie felt very
tired, and said so.  When it was eight bells in
the middle watch he was still asleep, or
pretended to be.  'Rouse out, howner,' said
Braby, and he shook Geordie up.
</p>

<p>
'I feels tolerable ill,' said Geordie.  'I don't
think I shall turn out.'
</p>

<p>
He didn't, and the rest of the port watch
went on deck by themselves.  At the muster
Mr. Potts didn't answer to his name.
</p>

<p>
'Mr Potts is hill, sir,' said the obsequious
watch; ''e said 'e couldn't turn out.'
</p>

<p>
'I thought it'd come soon,' said Brose to
himself, and he went for'ard to the fo'c'sle.
</p>

<p>
'Are you <i>very</i> ill?' he asked drily.
</p>

<p>
'I don't know quite how I feel,' said the
owner, 'but I thinks a little drop of brandy
would do me good.'
</p>

<p>
'I wish I could poison it,' said Brose under
his voice.  'This is most 'umiliatin' to a man
in the persition of an officer.'
</p>

<p>
By noon Geordie was well enough to sit on
deck and smoke a pipe.  The 'old man' came
to see him.
</p>

<p>
'Wouldn't you like a berth aft now, Mr. Potts?'
urged the skipper.
</p>

<p>
'I'll think about it, captain,' said Geordie.
'And in the meantime I don't think I'll turn to.'
</p>

<p>
The skipper looked at Brose.
</p>

<p>
'We can dispense with Mr. Potts's services
for the time, eh, Mr. Brose?'
</p>

<p>
'Certingly,' said Brose.  But he walked to
the rail and spat into the great Pacific.
</p>

<p>
From that time onward Geordie did no work
to speak of except to take his trick at the wheel.
And when they were south of the Horn he
decided to do that no longer.
</p>

<p>
'If you'll take my wheel for the rest of the
passage I'll double your wages,' he said to
Braby.  And Braby jumped at the offer.  In
the morning Geordie went on the poop.  It was
noticeable that he went up the weather poop
ladder.  Except in cases of hurry and emergency
at sea such a thing is next door to gross
insubordination.
</p>

<p>
'I ain't goin' to take no more wheels,' said
Geordie; 'and Braby will take mine.  I've
doubled his wages.'
</p>

<p>
Even old Smith gasped.  As for Brose he
felt sea-sick for the first time since he first went
down Channel in an outward-bounder thirty years before.
</p>

<p>
'I'll make a note of it,' said the skipper.
</p>

<p>
They shortened sail in a devilish quick flurry
of a gale out the south-west later in the day,
and, as all the topsails were down on the cap
at once it was 'jump' and no mistake.  As an
act of kindly condescension the owner went
to the wheel and shoved away the Dutchman
there who was congratulating himself at not
being on a topsail-yard.
</p>

<p>
'Get aloft, you Dutch swab,' said Geordie.
'I'll take her for you.'
</p>

<p>
And Mr. Ware bellowed like a bull, for he
had a fine fore-topsail-yard voice, and when it
was a real breeze his language rose with the
seas and was fine and flowery, vigorous and
ornamental and magnificent.  While he was in
the middle of a peroration which would have
excited envy in Cicero, or Burke, or a barrister
with no case, he heard the owner shouting.
For a private interview with the steward had
given Geordie great confidence.
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Ware, Mr. Ware, I'd be glad if you'd
cuss the men less.  I don't like it.'
</p>

<p>
The chief officer collapsed as if he were a
balloon with a hole in it, and for the next
minute he and the skipper engaged in an
excited conversation.
</p>

<p>
'I can't, can't stand it,' said Ware.
</p>

<p>
'You must,' said old Smith almost tearfully.
</p>

<p>
And Ware did stand it.  But, when the
<i>Patriarch</i> was shortened down and he left the
deck, he went below and swore very horribly
for five minutes by any chronometer.  'Now
I know what Brose feels,' said Ware.  'I've
a great sympathy for poor Brose.'
</p>

<p>
The owner ordered a tot for all hands when
they came down from aloft.  And he called the
cook aft and harangued him from the break
of the poop.
</p>

<p>
'Now, Mr. Spoil-Grub, mind you cook better
than you've been doin', or I'll have you
ducked in a tub and set your mate to doin'
your work.'
</p>

<p>
He turned to the skipper with a beaming
smile in his blue eyes.
</p>

<p>
'I can talk straight, can't I, cap?' he
hiccupped blandly.  'I'm thinkin' I'll lie down in
the cabin.'
</p>

<p>
And when the 'old man' went below he
found Geordie dossing in his own sacred bunk.
The poor old chap went and sat in the cabin
and put his head in his hands.  'This is a most
horrid experience,' he said mournfully.  'I
don't like howners on board.  I don't like 'em
a bit!'
</p>

<p>
But it was not only the afterguard who
suffered.  Geordie shifted his dunnage aft at
last, and though he left the skipper's berth
when he was sober, he made himself very
comfortable in the steward's.  And he loafed about
all day on deck with his pipe in his mouth.
He began to look at the men with alien eyes.
</p>

<p>
'I tell you they're loafin', said he to Ware.
'Don't I know 'em.  They watches you like
cats, and when your eyes are off 'em they do
nothin'.  I'm payin' 'em to work and I'm
payin' you to make 'em.  There's a leak
somewhere.'
</p>

<p>
And he addressed the crowd from the poop.
</p>

<p>
'You're a lazy lot,' he said; 'that's wot you
are.  For two pins I'd cut the galley-fire and
your afternoon watch below!'
</p>

<p>
And next day he raised their wages.  A week
later he cut them down again.  The skipper
had a hard job to keep track of what the ship
owed them.
</p>

<p>
'I wish we was home,' groaned old Smith.
'Oh, he'll be a hell of an owner.'
</p>

<p>
'I'll murder him,' said Brose.
</p>

<p>
'Wot did I tell you, chaps, about the 'orrid
effec's of sudden richness in a man?' asked the
old fo'c'sle man for'ard.  'Geordie Potts was
a good sort, but Mr. George Potts, Esquire,
is an 'oly terror.  'E raises hus hup an' cuts
hus down like grass.'
</p>

<p>
And it presently came about that the only
time they had any peace was when Geordie
was very much intoxicated.  But when they
got into the calms of Capricorn on the home
stretch to the north he developed a taste
for gambling, and made the old skipper sit
up all night playing 'brag' for huge sums
of money.
</p>

<p>
'I lends you the dibs, and, win or lose, it's
all hunky for you,' said Geordie.  He wrote out
orders to pay the 'old man' several thousand
pounds, and Smith began to feel rich.  Then
Geordie raked Ware into the game.  At last
even Brose succumbed to the lure of 'I
promises to pay Mr. Brose five hundred on the
nail,' and joined the gamble.
</p>

<p>
'This is a dash comfortable ship,' said
Geordie.  'What's a few thousands to me?
I don't mind losin'.  Stoo'ard, bring rum.'
</p>

<p>
By the time they picked up the north-east
trader, old Smith owed the 'owner' ten
thousand pounds.  Ware was five thousand to the
good, and Brose, who had played poker in
California, was worth fifteen thousand in strange
paper.  He began to dream of a row of houses
with a public-house at each end.  He and
Geordie grew quite thick, and compared
public-house ideals.
</p>

<p>
'I'm goin' to buy a hotel,' said Geordie;
'there's one in Trafalgar Square, London, as
I've in my mind.  I'll fit up the bar till it fair
blazes with golden bottles.'
</p>

<p>
He borrowed the mate's clothes, and had a
roaring time.  And then they came into the
Channel, picked up a tug, and went round the
Foreland into London River.
</p>

<p>
'I'll bet lawyers and so on will be down to
meet me,' said Geordie.  'They'll be full up
with gold.  To think of it!  And to think I hit
my poor old uncle with a brick.'
</p>

<p>
He mourned over his brutality.
</p>

<p>
'He wasn't half a bad chap,' he said, 'and I
don't see what call my dad had to call him a
blood-sucker, after all.'
</p>

<p>
They docked in the South-West dock, and
sure enough they had not been alongside their
berth five minutes before old Tyser's usual
London agent and a very legal-looking person
came on board.
</p>

<p>
'Let me interduce you to the new owner,'
said the obsequious skipper, as he led up
Geordie, who had a smile on him large enough
to cut a mainsail out of.
</p>

<p>
'Oh,' said the lawyer, 'then this is Mr. Potts?'
</p>

<p>
'That's me,' said Geordie.  'Have you
brought any money with you?  I owes Mr. Ware
five thousand and Mr. Brose fifteen.'
</p>

<p>
The lawyer smiled.
</p>

<p>
'I'm afraid there's some mistake, Mr. Potts.
Your uncle left a will after all.'
</p>

<p>
Geordie's jaw dropped, and so did Ware's.
But Brose's fell as falls the barometer in the
centre of a cyclone.
</p>

<p>
'And me&mdash;did he leave me nothin'?' roared
Geordie.
</p>

<p>
'Oh yes,' said the solicitor.  'Mr. Gray, will
you kindly give me that cash-box you are
carrying?'
</p>

<p>
And the agent handed him the cash-box.
</p>

<p>
'He left you this,' said the lawyer.  'And in
this sealed envelope is the key.'
</p>

<p>
And Geordie grabbed the box eagerly.
</p>

<p>
'It's heavy,' he said, 'it's tolerable heavy.'
</p>

<p>
And putting it on the rail, he opened it with
the key.
</p>

<p>
There was half a brick in it.

<h3>
THE ORDER OF THE WOODEN GUN
</h3>

<p>
Bertie Fortescue was twenty-three, he
weighed twelve stone, was rather fatter than
he should have been, and wore an eyeglass.
His father was good to him, his mother spoiled
him, he had not been to a public school, and
had never had a thrashing in his life.  He
believed in himself, in clothes and money, and
imagined he was born to rule men.  He was
trying, it was for the first time, in the steamship
<i>Pilgrim</i> of 6000 tons register, owners Fortescue
and Son of Liverpool, bound from New Orleans
to Cape Town with a cargo of mules and horses
for the British Government.  The <i>Pilgrim</i> was
three days out from the mixed mouths of the
Mississippi, and already there was the devil to
pay and no pitch hot.
</p>

<p>
'Trouble, didn't I smell trouble like a
gas-works?' said Bob Wadd.  'It stuck out a foot
while we were lyin' at the Picayune Tier.  And
just as soon as I heerd old Fortescue was took
sick, and that dear Bertie was goin' to come
with us to manage these blighted 'orse-keepers,
I knewed cyclones would be nothing to the
ructions that was in sight.  And look at the
old man!'
</p>

<p>
He appealed to his shipmates to look, in
their minds, at the skipper, and say what they
thought of him.  Wadd objected to Captain
Scantlebury's white hair, to his meek manner,
to his way of walking, which was a waddle, to
his religion, to everything that was his.
</p>

<p>
'Sings 'ymns, don't 'e?' said Wadd scornfully,
'preaches, don't 'e?  And don't drink
neither, oh no!  Reads the <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>,
a reg'lar child's book!'
</p>

<p>
'Gahn, it's a log-book he wrote hisself about
this packet,' said Green, as they sat in the
fo'c'sle in the second dog-watch, with the rest
of the men listening.
</p>

<p>
'You're an ignorant man, Green,' replied
Wadd; 'I'd fair despise to argue with you
about books.  'Owsever, 'ere we are, out to sea,
and the skipper and mates dunno where they
are with this 'oly crowd of 'orse-keepers, and
dear young Bertie walkin' about among 'em
with his revolver out and his eyes starin' and
usin' delicate language to 'em.  There's trouble
right ahead, and hany moment there may be
bloodshed.'
</p>

<p>
For once a foremast growler hit the situation
off to a T.  And no one else did, except some
of the mixed gathering who had shipped in the
<i>Pilgrim</i>, one to every seventeen horses, to look
after them on their way to the war.
</p>

<p>
'It's almost peaceful now,'said the skipper,
'it was a great and blessed relief to send the
carpenters ashore.  Their hammering drove
me mad.  How are you getting along with the
horse-keepers, Mr. Fortescue?'
</p>

<p>
Bertie Fortescue nodded drily.
</p>

<p>
'I've got 'em to rights,' he said; 'they see
already they can't impose on me.  I let 'em see
right off that I carried a revolver and meant to
stand no nonsense.  With men of their class
it's no use being soft sawdery, is it?'
</p>

<p>
Old Scantlebury might be soft, but he was
not quite a fool or without experience.
</p>

<p>
'I wouldn't be too hard on 'em, Mr. Fortescue,'
he said anxiously, 'they're a very
tough lot.'
</p>

<p>
'I'll show 'em I'm tougher,' said Bertie
firmly, as he stuck his eyeglass in his eye.
'They'll not impose on me.  They respect me
already.  I can see it.'
</p>

<p>
The holy gang that respected him were
shrieking for'ard at that very moment over
Mr. Herbert Fortescue, of Messrs. Fortescue &amp;
Son.  For as it happened, there were several
humourists among them as well as several who
ought to have been hanged, and the jokers
leavened the whole lump so that there was
peace at present, if the row was to come
later.
</p>

<p>
'Hell,' said Arizona Bill, 'did you ever see
such a thing as thishyer Fortescue?'
</p>

<p>
'I should smile,' replied a man from Michigan,
'by the holy Mackinaw, he's a daisy,
Fortescue!  What'll we call him, boys?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, call him Bertie, that's his name too,'
cried some one from British Columbia.  'The
next time he gives me taffy, I'll say, "Dry up,
Bertie!"'
</p>

<p>
Arizona grinned.
</p>

<p>
'Boys, it's Bertie all the time.  Did you
pipe his gun?  That elegant dude with a gun!
Bought it for us, boys.  And his voice, too.
"Hee'ar, men, pawss this aw&mdash;rope throo
this&mdash;aw&mdash;thing, aw!"  Oh, he makes me sick!
Does he know a horse from a mewel!  Oh,
ain't he tender, and so green and juicy!  But
that thing, and a gun, is what fetches me
every time.  He'll shorely be pullin' it down
on one of us, onless one of these mustangs
kindly plants his heels in his stomach and lays
him out.'
</p>

<p>
There were plenty of mustangs equal to the
job if they hadn't been moored so close.  For
the <i>Pilgrim's</i> fifteen hundred mixed rakings and
scrapings of Texas included many able equine
gymnasts, many supremely skilled kickers,
many that looked for some one to bite as if
indeed all flesh was grass.  There were real
horses on board; there were imitations; some
had pedigrees and were unsound, some had no
pedigrees and were no sounder; some had
teeth and some hadn't.  There were mustangs,
'Kieutans,' bronchos, ponies.  Some could be
ridden, some no one could ride.  They could,
however, be sold, and England bought them.
They were black and grey, white and brown,
and bay and sorrel.  There were 'painted'
horses, or Pintos, skewbalds and piebalds;
there were claybanks, and true buckskins, some
with black and some with silver tails and
manes; some half-hairless, patchy, some with
heads like battered fiddles, some with rumps
like ancient hatstands; some were blind, some
wall-eyed, some were fat and some thin, some
worth dollars, others worth cents, but all
costing gold because the British Empire was in the
market shouting for horses, and yelling 'I'll
take all you've got!'
</p>

<p>
But if the horses were mixed brutes, the men
that looked after them were no less a marvellous
collection of terrible uniques.  Old Bob Wadd
reckoned them up.
</p>

<p>
'There's Texans 'ere, and some from Arizona,
and half a dozen bleeding Mexicans, and three
real Dutchmen, and two Danes and a Finn, and
some real Spaniards and a one-eyed blackguard
from Vennyzweela, and seven nigs, and a bally
Kanaka, and several English and three Irish,
and two Kanucks and three Canadian Frenchmen.
That's all I've marked off, but bimeby,
I expects a Greek, and a Rooshian, and a
Prooshan, and a Turk, and a Chinaman will
turn up.  Oh, they've the 'oliest lot of unhung
pirates I ever see on board a ship or on a wharf!
And dear, dear Bertie 'as the management of
'em!  Shipmates, mark my words, you'll 'ave
a tale to pitch when you 'ops ashore out of this
horse-packet as'll curl hair equal to any curlin'
tongs.  The first time it blows and the 'orses
begin to kick and peg out, Bertie and these
shinin' gems out of the jool-case they calls
Noo Orl'ans, will be 'aving awful arguments
on the main deck.  I smells trouble afar off
like, as I said afore, from a gasworks or a
candle factory.'
</p>

<p>
The two mates said the same.  They said it
to themselves.  They said it to the 'old
man.'  The first mate groaned to the second greaser,
and even to the third.
</p>

<p>
'Forder, I opine there will be serious difficulties
yet between this young Fortescue and
these horse-keepers.'
</p>

<p>
Mr. White always 'opined'; it was as
favourite a word with him as 'exploit' is with
a socialist orator, or as 'transpire' is with a
third-rate journalist.
</p>

<p>
'I opine there will be serious difficulty,'
repeated the chief.
</p>

<p>
'Would you mind, sir, if I told you
my opinion of Mr. Fortescue?' asked the
second.
</p>

<p>
'Not in the least,' said Mr. White.
</p>

<p>
'Then I think he's the biggest ass I ever set
eyes on,' said the disgusted Forder, 'and I
hope some of that bally gang will take away
that glass eye of his and his revolver and throw
'em both overboard.'
</p>

<p>
'I opine it would do him good,' said Mr. White
pensively.
</p>

<p>
'I'm darn well sure it would, sir,' said
Forder; 'I could have put up with old
Mr. Fortescue, though I never knew any good
come from havin' owners on board, but his
son and heir gives me the hump.  It's bad
enough havin' a cargo of horses, and worse
havin' these pit scrapin's to tend 'em, but
Mr. Bertie makes me tired.  If he gets into trouble
with these Texans for'ard, the old man can read
him out of it with hymns and the <i>Pilgrim's
Progress</i> for all I care.  I've been in the West,
and I know he can't bull-doze this crowd.  Oh,
he makes me weary!'
</p>

<p>
When there is trouble in a ship, there's
trouble for all hands.  And trouble was
certainly breezing up to windward, because the
<i>Pilgrim</i> struck in on a southern edge of a
cyclonic disturbance coming up from the
eastward on its way north-west, and the westerly
gale that played with them made matters
extremely lively for every one.  It was the purest
misfortune for all on board the <i>Pilgrim</i> that
Bertie was not sick, though he had never been
in bad weather before.  It increased his good
opinion of himself, which stood in no need of
any increase.  He swaggered as if he were
an old salt, and had been pickled in the year of
Trafalgar.
</p>

<p>
'All these brutes forward are sick, Captain
Scantlebury,' said Bertie haughtily.  'They
are a lot of useless scum&mdash;aw.  Those that
aren't ill don't know a horse from a mule,
and those that know a mule from a horse
are too ill to know themselves from a bale
of hay.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't be too hard on 'em, sir,' urged the old
skipper.  'This won't last long, and when they
get over bein' sick, they'll be all right.'
</p>

<p>
'If I was as soft&mdash;aw&mdash;as you want me to be,'
said Bertie, 'they'd walk over the lot of us.
I've just booted three to work, and I'll boot the
rest in about three minutes, or I'll know the
reason why, confound them!'
</p>

<p>
He went forward along the main deck and
interviewed some of his men.  Among them
he interviewed one Arizona Bill, who was in a
state of collapse to which he had long been a
stranger.  As he explained later, sea-sickness
was an illness which resembled the results of
drink combined with cholera and a few other
very fatal diseases, and it took all the stiffening
out of a man.
</p>

<p>
'Get up and get to work,' said Bertie pitilessly.
</p>

<p>
'Not much,' said poor Arizona, 'I'm dyin'&mdash;  Oh!'
</p>

<p>
He said 'Oh' several times.
</p>

<p>
'Get up, or I'll kick thunder out of you,' said
Bertie.
</p>

<p>
Even in collapse a gleam came in Arizona's eye.
</p>

<p>
'Don't you kick me, Bertie, or I'll kill you
when I'm well,' he said.
</p>

<p>
And Forder came along just in time to prevent
Bertie doing what he said.  Forder grabbed
him by the arm.
</p>

<p>
'You don't know what you're aimin' at,
sir,' said Forder.  'Do you reckon they'll be
sick the whole passage, Mr. Fortescue?  If
you want to kick any one, go and kick a
Dutchman.'
</p>

<p>
Bertie wrenched his arm loose.
</p>

<p>
'Confound you, sir, let go my arm!  What
the devil do you mean by interfering with me,
sir?  I'll sack you in Cape Town the very
moment we get there.  He&mdash;he called me
<i>Bertie</i>!'
</p>

<p>
'Sack? be hanged,' said Forder.  'And did
he call you Bertie?  Well, you are Bertie, aren't
you?  But you're green too, or you wouldn't
threaten to boot an American of that sort.'
</p>

<p>
'You don't know who you're talking to,'
said Bertie furiously.  'For two pins I'd knock
you down.'
</p>

<p>
Forder walked for'ard.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, go to bed,' he said contemptuously.
But in less than ten minutes he was interviewing
the 'old man,' and explaining how he had
saved Mr. Fortescue's life.  The skipper abused
him severely.
</p>

<p>
'I shall be compelled to take the very
severest steps with you, Mr. Forder,' piped the
old man.
</p>

<p>
'You can't do worse, sir, than send me
for'ard and fire me at Cape Town and mark me
D.R.,' said Forder in the civilest tone, 'and
I'm ready to shift my dunnage for'ard right
now, sir.  But I tell you that Mr. Fortescue
won't get to Cape Town at all if he plays up
with those chaps for'ard.'
</p>

<p>
'I can take care of myself,' roared Bertie,
'and I don't require your advice.'
</p>

<p>
'You'll get no more of it,' said Forder.
</p>

<p>
'There, there,' said the skipper, 'of course
you'll get no more of it, Mr. Fortescue.
Mr. Forder says you won't.  That will do, Forder.
I am exceedingly displeased, outraged,
annoyed.  But as you have apologised you can go.'
</p>

<p>
Forder opened his mouth, shut it again,
scratched his head, looked at Bertie, sighed,
and went down the port poop ladder very
slowly.  When he reached the deck he walked
across to his own berth, put his head inside,
and swore vigorously.  After this relief he went
for'ard again.
</p>

<p>
'I don't care what trouble there is,' he said,
'so long as it ain't bloody trouble.  I'll have
a yarn with this Arizona chap as soon as he
stops sayin' "Oh," so bad.  I ain't bin in
Texas myself, flat footin' it over the ties, without
knowin' the breed.'
</p>

<p>
He did know them, and it is very possible
that his hard-earned knowledge turned a tragedy
into a comedy, and helped to make a man of
the owner's son, instead of a very good-looking
corpse.  For it must be owned that Bertie was
not a bad-looking young fellow, and had the
makings of a man in him under his conceit.
</p>

<p>
The wind took off that night, for the centre
of the cyclone moved steadily to the north-west,
while the <i>Pilgrim</i> was heading more to the
south of east, with Trinidad on her starboard
quarter.  Forder's watch below that night was
from eight to twelve, and he took the chance of
seeing Arizona Bill, who had now ceased to
say 'Oh,' and was saying 'Ah' with a sense
of deep relief as he lay on a hay bale, and
wondered what folly had brought him to sea
when there was so much solid prairie in
Arizona.
</p>

<p>
'How are you makin' it?' asked Forder.
</p>

<p>
Arizona sighed.
</p>

<p>
'Why, sir, I'm of opinion I shan't actuly
die this time.  But I've a mighty strange
feelin' of a void within that I've no rek'lection
of experiencin' since I was three days without
hash in the neighbourhood of the Californian
mountings.  Thishyer sea-sick business is a
holy terror, and some new to me.  I'd admire
to see my enemies takin' a hand in the game
while I stood out.'
</p>

<p>
'To-morrow you'll be as fit as a fiddle,' said
Forder, 'it'll do you good&mdash;scrape out your
limbers, so to speak.'
</p>

<p>
Arizona shook his towzled head.
</p>

<p>
'Well, sir, I'd ruther be done good to more
gently, for if thishyer's a cure for indigestion
as the cook reckons, it should be a root cure
and no fatal error.  And now I rek'lects it
was you as stopped that boy Bertie from doin'
suthin' he'd ha' bin mighty sorry for!  Sir,
I thank you!  I was mighty sick at that
moment, and I felt near my latter end, and
was helpless as a babe.'
</p>

<p>
Forder grinned.
</p>

<p>
'Excuse my smilin', partner,' he said, 'but
somehow I can't help it when I think of people
bein' sea-sick.'
</p>

<p>
Arizona sighed.
</p>

<p>
'Grin, my son, I ain't complainin'.  It
makes me smile to see a tenderfoot tackle a
buckin' horse.  I reckon I'm a tenderfoot at sea.'
</p>

<p>
'Do you know Fort Worth?' asked Forder.
</p>

<p>
'Do I know my dear yearthly home from
the cold clouds of heaven?' asked Arizona
contemptuously.  'I know Fort Worth like
ez if it wuz my pants.  Wuz you ever thar?'
</p>

<p>
'Ay,' said Forder, 'I was flat bust there,
and slung hash for a month at Canadian Pete's.'
</p>

<p>
Arizona held out a limp hand.
</p>

<p>
'Shake, pard,' he said.  And Forder shook.
</p>

<p>
'I reckoned as there wuz somethin' not so
green about you ez the others,' said Arizona.
'Havin' been in Texas is a great deal, oh,
it's a great deal towards an eddication.  But
Arizona&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'I was in Arizona too,' said Forder, 'at Tombstone!'
</p>

<p>
'I'm dod-busted,' cried Arizona, quite
forgetting he was ill, 'squat alongside and tell
us what you wuz doing over to Tombstone.
This is real pie, ain't it?  I yearns strangely
over the plains of Arizona.  Shake again!
Tombstone, waal, I'm doggoned!  Did you
know Red Pete?'
</p>

<p>
'No, but&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Or Apache Adams, him without ears?
Geronimo ear-marked him.'
</p>

<p>
'I've seen him,' said Forder.
</p>

<p>
And they let right into a yarn about Arizona
and the Apaches, and Adams and Red Pete,
and Ginger Simpson and Two-thumbed
Thompson till the stars came out.
</p>

<p>
'But about this Mr. Fortescue?' said Forder,
when the well of reminiscence was about
dry.  'I want to know what the trouble will be?'
</p>

<p>
Arizona Bill looked exceedingly disagreeable.
He would have impressed a member of the
Peace Society very unfavourably.
</p>

<p>
'Bertie's goin' to die, I reckon,' he said
simply.  'He cayn't survive long, if my
opinion is worth a cent.  He kicked three of
the boys, though one don't count bein' a
Dutchman, and he used language, which the
Governor of no State could pardon, to Ben
Wilkins.'
</p>

<p>
Forder nodded.
</p>

<p>
'Damn young ass,' he said, 'but, Arizona,
let him down light.  If any one shoots him,
he'll be hung.  This is a British ship, and
he'll be tried at Cape Town, not in Tombstone.'
</p>

<p>
'If he fell overboard,' said Arizona, 'there's
seventy of us here to try.  He don't know what
dynamite he's monkeyin' with.'
</p>

<p>
'That's so,' said Forder, 'he don't know,
and might be taught.  You're the top dog in
this crowd, ain't you?'
</p>

<p>
'I might be,' said Arizona cautiously.
</p>

<p>
'And you'd oblige me if you could?'
</p>

<p>
'I would, you're a white man,' said Arizona,
'even if you are an Englishman.'
</p>

<p>
Forder, who thoroughly understood the
Western attitude towards Englishmen, took no
notice of the last part of Arizona's declaration.
</p>

<p>
'Then treat him like the baby that he is.'
</p>

<p>
'Eh, what, smack him, for instance?' said
Arizona eagerly.
</p>

<p>
'Anything you like, except kill him, my son.'
</p>

<p>
'I see,' said Arizona, 'take his gun from
him, and so on.'
</p>

<p>
'I'm givin' no advice,' replied Forder.
</p>

<p>
'That's all hunky, I tumble to the racket,'
said Arizona.  'I reckons he sets a high value
on that glass eye of his, eh?'
</p>

<p>
'It looks like it,' said Forder.
</p>

<p>
'We'll kapsualla it, as B.C. Bob says, and
give it to the Major.  He let on he'd worn 'em
once.  He wuz in your British Army, and now
he's the toughest hoodoo on board.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, give it the Major then,' said Forder,
and he went off.
</p>

<p>
He met Bertie on the main deck, and they
passed as if they were strangers in the Strand.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, go to bed,' said Forder to himself.  But
he knew he had done a good deed.
</p>

<p>
'Haw, bumptious ass, haw,' said Bertie, who
had no notion how grateful he ought to be to
the man who knew Texas and Arizona, and
the pride of those who grow upon the high
plateaus of the South-West.  He didn't know
for several days, and the reason for his
remaining ignorant was the comic spirit that endures
in man in all the strange places of the world
and sea, and makes laughter flourish on the
barrenest soil.
</p>

<p>
There were twelve hundred horses and mules
on board, and though they were packed a bit
over-closely there was plenty of ventilation,
and at least half the men in charge knew a
horse from a harmonium.  As the men who
knew were naturally the bosses by birth and
education, having been mostly born in Texas
and educated on the prairie, the unlearned
learned because they had to.  It was not an
unhappy ship for the horses, even though
Bertie knew as much about them as he did
about men.  What was due to Arizona and
Ben Wilkins and half a dozen others he put
down to himself.  And he was much surprised
at the peculiar change which came over the
whole horse crowd as soon as they ran into
good weather and went along on an even keel.
For the first ten days every one had been sick
and sorry and savage, and now the main deck
and the 'tween-decks fairly rang with laughter.
</p>

<p>
'Aw, they've come to their bearings,' said
Bertie, who liked sea terms, which he sometimes
used quite accurately.  'I think, Captain
Scantlebury, that the men are very amenable
after all; my severity&mdash;aw&mdash;with them when
they were complaining of sea-sickness did them
good.  That fellow they call Arizona Bill has
a very good idea of handling horses, and I
can see he now thoroughly understands that
I am not to be scared or imposed upon.'
</p>

<p>
The skipper was obsequiously glad to hear it.
</p>

<p>
'Ah, sir, I always said to your father that
you knew what's what, even as a boy.  Dear,
dear me, to think I remember you when you
weighed no more than half a hundred.  Going
through life is a strange Pilgrim's Progress,
sir, and here we are in the <i>Pilgrim</i> goin'
straight ahead in a calm sea, all so peaceful
and so happy, that I could sing a hymn all
the way to Cape Town with horses.  Oh, but
war's a sad, sad thing.'
</p>

<p>
'Old ass,' said the brutal Forder, whose
watch on deck it was, 'which is the biggest,
the old man or Bertie, tires me to calculate.
I'd rather work out lunars with a monkey-wrench
than try to take the altitude of these
asses.  He's got 'em down fine, has he?  Sing
hymns all the way to the Cape, eh?  Oh, my
stars!  We'll be hard and fast ashore on a
reef of woe in a twinkle.  The horse-crowd's
devilish merry this night!'
</p>

<p>
And so they were.  For after their supper
the unholiest gang of them all was gathered
on the fore-hatch on the orlop deck, and they
made the horses, who twisted their necks round
to see what was going on, wonder more than
ever what strange animals men were.  Arizona
lay on the hatch, and with him was Ben
Wilkins.  The Major, who indeed had been
an officer in a crack cavalry regiment, chewed
tobacco while resting against the coamings.
Seth Evans and Missouri Jack were among
the crowd.  So were the Mexicans, though
they sat aloof.  Manuel, the one-eyed
blackguard from Venezuela, was there too.  And
in the background were the Dutchmen, who
included real Hollanders, Danes, a Swede
named Hans, and a Finn known as Tubby
when he was called anything.  A dozen
lanterns cast a glimmering and unequal light on
this party in Tophet.  Arizona had the floor,
so to speak.  He was very fluent.
</p>

<p>
'Boys,' said Arizona, 'air we all in this?'
</p>

<p>
'To bee sure!' said Ben Wilkins, 'the man
that ain't goes out with the muck next
mucking-out, if I'm any authority on the doings
in this ole packet!'
</p>

<p>
'Don't discourage any of us,' said Arizona.
'Ben, you're too fiery.  I've known men
that'd die sooner than be encouraged your
way.  Your talk inspires a sperrit of rebellion
in the brave.  Let us confine ourselves to the
programme which is entitled as a drayma,
"The Takin' Down of Bertie."  Bertie, boys,
is the boss.'
</p>

<p>
'Boss o' blazes!' said Ben.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, shucks!' said Arizona, 'do dry up
and let me orate.  Am I the orator or ain't I?
If I'm the orator let me orate in peace; if I
ain't, I'll stand out and be as silent as the
grave.  I was talkin'&mdash;aw&mdash;about dear
Bertie&mdash;aw&mdash;who walks round with a new silvery gun,
a forty-five frontier pistol, in his nice clean
hands, in order to reduce this unholy crowd
to a proper sense o' their subordination.  Who
is it carries a nice new gun, boys?'
</p>

<p>
'Bertie carries a nice new gun,' said the
crowd, shrieking with laughter.
</p>

<p>
'Bertie's paw owns thishyer horse-packet, and
is some sick in New Orl'ans right now,' went
on Arizona, 'but if his son, who'll own this
<i>Pilgrim</i> when he paysses in his checks, was
to be filled up with lead, the ole man would
be some disgruntled.  Who's sick paw would
be some disgruntled if Bertie was to stop lead,
boys?'
</p>

<p>
'Bertie's paw would be some disgruntled,'
answered the crowd.
</p>

<p>
'Does we, the kind and peaceful crowd that
looks after horses, need guns to subdue our
bloodthirsty instincts?' asked Arizona.  'Far
from it, boys.  We come from the calm prairies
of Texas and sunny Arizona, where peace
flourishes for ever and no man dies without
askin' for death, except in some fatal instances
that may be looked on as accidents.  We are
all sorts here, Texans, Arizonians, Californians,
Henglishmen, Kanucks, Mexicanos, but all
serenely devoted to the cause of peace.  Who's
the disturbing influence here, waltzing round
with a gun, boys?'
</p>

<p>
'Bertie is,' said the crowd unanimously.
</p>

<p>
'Who is it that says "aw" to freeborn
citizens of the United States, to men from
Chihuahua, to down-trodden subjects of the
King of England and the Emperor of Prussia?'
</p>

<p>
'Bertie does,' affirmed the crowd.
</p>

<p>
'And looks at sons of the prairie and the
mountain through a piece of glass, which the
Major here discarded years ago.  Who does that?'
</p>

<p>
And the crowd said that 'dear Bertie did.'
</p>

<p>
'I calls all freemen with a clarion voice, to
say nothin' of a bugle, to rise and put him
down,' said Arizona.  'We can endure much,
and can endure it long.  But the worm turns
at last, and dear Bertie is doomed.  Boys,
who is doomed?'
</p>

<p>
'Dear Bertie,' said the crowd; 'dear Bertie
is doomed!'
</p>

<p>
'He is doomed to have his gun taken from
him, and his eyeglass, if the Major won't have
it, shall be destroyed by the heel of freedom.
Boys, I have done.'
</p>

<p>
'Bully for you,' said the Major, 'I'll take
the eyeglass.'
</p>

<p>
And the ingenious orator went on deck with
his fellow-conspirators to take the evening air,
and commune with the genial and gentlemanly
stokers.  The cinder-shifters owned with much
amazement that the most promising Whitechapel
hero with the fire-rake was not a patch
on the chief ruffians from Louisiana and Texas.
They admired Arizona wonderfully, were
marvellously civil to Ben Wilkins, who was a
murderous devil in his heart, and sat at the
feet of 'Mizzoura' Jack and Seth Graves, his
partner.  Neither of them could go back to
Missouri, and they said they didn't want to.
At least Jack said so.  Seth was as silent as a
cemetery.
</p>

<p>
'I've a notion,' said Arizona, when he was
through his second pipe, 'I've a notion as it'll
be best to decorate Bertie for his doin's hyar.'
</p>

<p>
'I'd decorate him with a bowie, but for
you're sayin' you'll regard it as a favour if I
don't,' said Ben Wilkins.
</p>

<p>
'You're ever too ready with the knife, my
son,' said Arizona, 'but if you'll stand aside
with me I'll furnish your barren and
uninventive genius with a harmless job for your
weepon, that you keep in your boot, which will
amuse Bertie worse than wounds.  Let's climb
up on what these gentlemen from the fiery
depths calls the <i>fiddley</i> deck, and I'll breathe
an elegant scheme into your starboard earhole,
which is ship's palaver for right ear.'
</p>

<p>
They climbed up, and presently Ben climbed
down and went hunting for a piece of board.
</p>

<p>
'Ter-morrer is the fatal day,' said Arizona.
'Jokin' will be the death of me.  But oh, dear
Bertie would almost make Seth Graves smile,
and as for me who was born with a rich endowment
of fun, I kin no more keep off him than a
bear off honey.'
</p>

<p>
The whole ship's company was down on
Bertie.  They were down on his eyeglass, on
his nice khaki clothes, on his revolver, on his
voice, which subtly implied that they were
nothing, and much less than zero.  And every one
on board, with the exception of the skipper,
and the chief officer and the chief engineer,
who came from Paisley, and was probably a
brother of the man who owned to coming from
there, but urged in extenuation, 'sure as deeth
I canna help it,' knew that something was
brewing among the aristocrats who looked
after the horses which boded Bertie no good.
Forder, of course, knew it, and said nothing.
The third officer knew it, and said a good
deal to the steward, who hated Bertie worse
than poison for telling him how to run his
business.  Bob Wadd and Green, and the rest
of the deck-hands, smelt it.  They smelt it like
Bob Wadd's gasworks, and rubbed their hands
joyously.  The firebrands down below used
most horrible language on the subject, and
wished that they could have Bertie in a bunker
for a watch to show him what running Cardiff
coal in an iron barrow was like.
</p>

<p>
'Blimy, and stri-me-pink, but I fair 'ytes
to ketch saight of 'im,' said the boss of the
whole gang of stokers.  'Thet vice of 'is syin'
"aw, aw," maikes me feel saime's I did first
taime I was blasted fool enough to come to sea.
I wunner wod them blokes of 'orse-keepers 'as
put up for 'im!  I 'opes it's somethin' that'll
larn 'im.'
</p>

<p>
He smote the burning fire with his rake as
if he was preparing a place for Bertie, and
slammed in a few shovels of coal vengefully.
But then stokers are stokers, and hard nuts to
deal with, and few men know them, and those
who do often wish they didn't.  It's no soft
job in a stokehold when the thermometer
marks 120°, and what little wind there is, is
a following breeze.
</p>

<p>
And Bertie walked round quite unconscious
of his doom.  But he was conscious, somehow,
that every one smiled at him.  Old Wadd
grinned and so did Green.  As he went along
the alleyway and by the ash-shoot, the stokers
taking air in that agreeable locality showed
their white teeth and made remarks, audible
but unintelligible, as he passed.  One-eyed
Venezuela grimaced like a damaged idol, and
said something blasphemous but humorous in
South American Spanish.  Some of the deckhands
said, 'What cheer!  Let her scoot,' as
they passed him.  Arizona said to Ben
something about being knocked as high as Gilroy's
kite, and Ben said, 'Aw, hell, aw, what?'  The
insolent and debauched Major, who was
only saved from dying of drink by going at
intervals where he couldn't get it, put a penny
in his left eye when he saw Bertie.  And a boy
from New Orleans, an elegant young ruffian of
the hoodlum type, yelled out 'Bertie!' from an
obscure corner of shadow.  In his heart Bertie
began to wonder whether he had the crowd
down to such a fine point as he had imagined.
But he hardened his heart and said, 'Aw,' and
flourished his gun, his nice new gun, and talked
horse till Ben Wilkins said insolently, 'Ain't
Mr. Fortescue a smart Aleck?' and Bertie
thought it was a compliment.
</p>

<p>
'Ter-morrer's the day of judgment,' said
Arizona, as he lay on a bale of hay and
squealed with laughter.  He went round the
'tween-decks and told the horses so, rubbing
their muzzles and pleasing the poor things very
much.  For he understood them as he did men,
and loved them, perhaps, a trifle better.
</p>

<p>
'Ain't it a pity, horses, that you warn't
endowed by a gen'rous Providence with a just
sense of the ridik'lous?  If, by a special
dispensation, you was so endowed, you'd smile to
know that Bertie, who talks horse like a burro,
will be showed his real rank in nature and
decorated with the newest thing in orders.'
</p>

<p>
He shook his head and again addressed his
equine friends.
</p>

<p>
'Boys, you're goin' to the war and will see
many jackasses in high places, but not a burro
among 'em equal in jackassery to Mr. Bertie
Fortescue.  Did you say you'd hev a bit of hay,
my son?  Here you are, then, and good night
to you.'
</p>

<p>
Everything went on wheels next day, and,
save for one little uproar, caused by Bertie's
not understanding what a Spaniard said, there
was no trouble.  Bertie talked severely to the
unintelligent ass who didn't understand
English, and a row was only saved by Arizona,
who could yap Mexican wau-wau like a native
of the country.  The Spaniard said something
not to be written, beginning with 'mucho,' and
Bertie said he accepted the apology, and put
away his gun.
</p>

<p>
'We're getting along first-rate, aw,' said
Bertie, and so the whole ship's company said
when night fell, and the stars came out and
looked down on the pilgrimage of the <i>Pilgrim</i>
on a calm sea, with just enough breeze from the
east of north to make the windsails worth their
positions in the general scheme of things.  And
at 5.30 P.M. the men took their grub, having
watered and fed the eager and impatient cargo,
and Ben Wilkins said the 'order' was ready.
</p>

<p>
'What order?' asked the rest eagerly.
</p>

<p>
''Tis between me and Arizona,' said Ben;
'and all I'll say is that it's for dear Bertie.
Wait, and you'll see.'
</p>

<p>
At three bells in the second dog-watch they
watered the horses again, as the weather was
rather more than warm, and at eight bells they
gave them hay for the last time till the morning.
Bertie went his rounds, and at half-past eight
was down on the orlop deck, which was so
badly lighted with electric light that the men
supplemented the electricity with lanterns.
Though there were fewer horses there than
on the 'tween-decks or the main deck, there
were more men down on the orlop deck than
on any other.  And they were obviously much
amused at something.  What it was the owner's
son did not know till he came right forward on
the starboard side, having begun for'ard on the
port side and walked aft.  He found quite a
gathering on the fore-hatch of No. 1 hold.  A
lot were sitting and the rest standing about
in two groups, with Ben and Arizona in the
midst.
</p>

<p>
'Good night, Bertie,' said some one from the
background.
</p>

<p>
'Who the devil said that?' asked Bertie.
He turned to Arizona.  'Was it you?'
</p>

<p>
'No, Bertie,' said Arizona, 'it warn't me,
dear; I wouldn't think of takin' such a liberty
with so fine a lookin' young man.  Was it you,
Ben?'
</p>

<p>
Ben shook his head.
</p>

<p>
'Not me, Bill.  Would I call a nice young
boy like him by such a horrid insultin' name?
No, it warn't me that called him Bertie.'
</p>

<p>
Bertie gasped.
</p>

<p>
'Haw&mdash;haw!'
</p>

<p>
And the crowd said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Aw&mdash;aw!'
</p>

<p>
And then the young fellow, who certainly
did not lack courage, made a bolt for the
biggest gang, and naturally caught the slowest
of the lot, who was a very harmless Dutchman.
He knocked him down and pulled out his
'gun.'  There was a dead silence for a
moment, and then Arizona stepped up to him.
</p>

<p>
'What are you producin' that very fine
weepon for?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
And Bertie roared&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'This is mutiny&mdash;mutiny!'
</p>

<p>
'Don't get excited, sir,' said Arizona; 'don't
get flighty or flurried.  With a tough and
horrid crowd like this always keep cool.  We
wants to know unanimous what your purpose
is in wearin' that weepon and pullin' it out and
flourishin' it permiscus?  For we're very peaceful
and worships peace, and hates to die.'
</p>

<p>
'Go&mdash;go to the devil!' said Bertie.  'Confound
you, let me pass.'
</p>

<p>
For now there were at least thirty men round
him, and some of the stokers who were off duty
stood in the background roaring with laughter.
</p>

<p>
'Make him hand over his gun, Bill,' said
Ben, edging closer.
</p>

<p>
'We'd like to look at it to see if it's a real
gun, sir,' said Arizona, with a very taking air
of simplicity.  'Some of us reckons it's real,
and some says your dad heeled you with a
wooden one to scare a timid lot of boys from
Arizona and Texas and Louisiana.  Please let
us look at it, sir.'
</p>

<p>
'Do, dear Bertie,' said the rest.  And what
happened then no one quite knew.  Some said
Bertie meant to shoot, some said he made a
break for the <i>brow</i> which was the horse-gangway
at the main hatch, and some say that Ben
grabbed him.  For about ten seconds there was
a rough-and-tumble on the fore-hatch, in which
three lanterns were finally expended, and then
from the rumpus there emerged a pale and
desperate Bertie, without a gun, in the grip of
Ben, Arizona, and the silent Seth Graves.  Jack
from Missouri had the gun.
</p>

<p>
'Boys, the verdict of this expert is that this
is a real gun,' said Jack, 'a real forty-five
Frontier pistol, loaded with real cartridges.  And if
you pulls the trigger hard it's likely to go off.'
</p>

<p>
'There, dear Bertie, see what you've been
monkeyin' with,' said Arizona.  'Mizzoura
knows a gun well.  You might have killed
one of us poor boys, mostly orphans too,
owin' to similar accidents happenin' to our
paws.'
</p>

<p>
But the speechless son of the owner found
his tongue.
</p>

<p>
'Let me go.  I'll kill some of you!  What
the devil do you mean?'
</p>

<p>
He struggled frantically, and found his
struggles entirely vain.  For Seth Graves had
him from behind in a clutch that it would have
taken a small and healthy grizzly bear to get
free of.
</p>

<p>
'I'll tell you what we mean,' said Ben, dusting
himself carefully.  'We mean to give you some
healthy advice.  Mebbe you remember kickin'
this child in the ribs when he was sick?'
</p>

<p>
'And me!' said Seth, who spoke for the first
and last time.
</p>

<p>
'And you let on that you would kick me,
boy,' said Arizona, 'and nothin' but the second
officer interferin' saved you from it.  Now we're
goin' to investigate your case and decide what
kind of immejit death will be joodishal.  Boys,
put a bale on the fore-hatch and I'll appint
myself judge with a view to strict impartiality,
for if I don't Ben Wilkins will, and he cayn't be
impartial, as he said las' night he'd decided to
hang the prisoner if he was appinted judge.'
</p>

<p>
He climbed on the bale.
</p>

<p>
'Boys, the Court is now sittin'.  No one that
the prisoner hez kicked can be on the jury.
Them as he hez pulled his gun on ain't
disqualified, or there wouldn't be no panel.  Bein'
sworn at ain't no disqualification neither.'
</p>

<p>
The jury was formed after several bitter
quarrels.  It was composed of a Louisiana
man called Buckeye Joe; a Canadian-Frenchman
known as French Pete; a young Californian
originally from Mendocino County, but
later from the San Francisco House of
Correction; a Finn; a Dutchman from Amsterdam;
an Englishman who had been born at sea, and
brought up in Australia; and the Major, who
in the struggle had annexed Bertie's eyeglass,
and was now wearing it with the curious effect
of making him look almost like a gentleman
again, and several others who came from
countries between Patagonia and Hudson's Bay.
</p>

<p>
'Our verdict is "Guilty,"' said the foreman,
Buckeye.
</p>

<p>
'Don't be previous,' said Arizona; 'he is
guilty, of course, we all know that, but we've
got to act impartial and hear some evidence.
And I've to sum up.  You look out for my
summing up, Bertie.  It'll make you squirm,
or I'm no true-born impartial citizen of the
United States.  Ben, take the stand and lay
your complaint against this bobtail burro.'
</p>

<p>
The helpless prisoner shook his head feebly.
He was entirely done for and seriously alarmed;
there wasn't a kick left in him.  Seth Graves'
job was now a sinecure, and he let him go.
</p>

<p>
'This lop-eared leper kicked me,' said Ben
Wilkins, who had been adding to his already
extensive vocabulary of picturesque abuse by
consorting with the stokers.  'He said "Get up,
you lazy loafin' scumpot, and do your dooty,"
and with that he booted me in the ribs.  If I
was on the jury I'd bawl for death.  And it's
only because you asked me to let him off,
Arizona, that I didn't slay him when I could
stand.  Boys, your verdict, if just, will be
"death."'
</p>

<p>
This was irregular, and Arizona said so.
</p>

<p>
'You ain't addressin' the jury, Ben,' said the
judge.  'You've no call to, either.  I'll do
that.  You can stand down.'
</p>

<p>
'I heven't hardly cleared my throat to begin
with,' urged Ben.  'I've a deal more to say,
oh, a deal more.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, dry up,' said Arizona.  'Who's running
this Court, you or me?  Where's the one-eyed
galoot from Caraccas?'
</p>

<p>
The one-eyed galoot from Caraccas testified
to having been smitten on the side of his head
by Bertie.  Bill translated the evidence without
editing it.  One-eye said he hadn't killed Bertie
because he was too sick to do it.  He addressed
the Mexicans on the jury with much fervour,
and though reproved by Bill, did not cease his
oration till Ben, who was jealous, pulled him
down.
</p>

<p>
A Dutchman spoke afterwards, but did not
meet with great sympathy from the judge.
</p>

<p>
'Cut it short,'said Bill, 'a Dutchman don't
count anyhow, hardly more'n a nigger.'
</p>

<p>
This was rather hard on three 'coons'
grinning in the background, and lighting up the
darkness with their teeth.  However, Dutchmen
and negroes are never really troublesome
unless they are in the majority, and no protest
was made.
</p>

<p>
After that Arizona refused to hear any more
evidence.
</p>

<p>
'That'll do the palaver,' he said, 'it's as
clear as the Missouri in flood-time that Bertie
is a gone coon.  He struck citizens of the
United States with a British shoe, and he
smote Caraccas over the cabeza with a
British hand.  The jury can consider their
verdict, while the judge considers his sentence.'
</p>

<p>
'Ain't the prisoner to be allowed no defence?'
asked old Wadd, who had been given the tip
there was something on.
</p>

<p>
'To bee sure,' said Bill.  'Bertie, can you
say anythin' to prevent your bein' found guilty
right off?'
</p>

<p>
'Go to the devil!' said Bertie.  'I'll have you
all in gaol for mutiny at Cape Town.'
</p>

<p>
'That's contempt of Court,' said Bill, 'but
we pass it by secure in the dignity of our high
office.  Is there any one who can testify on
behalf of poor doomed Bertie before the verdict
is announced?'
</p>

<p>
Not a soul volunteered.
</p>

<p>
'What! no witnesses ez to character?'
asked Bill.  'Would the seafaring gentleman
in the background, who threw some reflections
on me just now by inquiring if the prisoner
warn't to hev no defence, like to speak on
behalf of Bertie?'
</p>

<p>
Bob Wadd shuffled uneasily.  But Green
egged him on.
</p>

<p>
'His old dad ain't a bad sort,' said Wadd at
last, with all that trepidation which paralyses
an Englishman in his first speech.  'His old
dad&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'So far the Court is with you,' said Arizona.
'But the evidence is what lawyers justly calls
irreverent.  His old dad has our sympathy, but
the griefs of the prisoner's parent cayn't
interfere with the course of justice.  Have you
anythin' else to allege on his behalf?'
</p>

<p>
'Well, the grub's good in this packet,'
said Wadd desperately.  'And old Mr. Fortescue&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, give us a rest,' said the judge.  'You
tire me, my son, by your continued irreverence.
The fact is you cayn't rake up the least thing
in favour of this benighted burro, and you slide
off on the matter of the chewing, just as if
the old man's notions of hash could help the
criminal I see before me.  Gentlemen of the
Jury, what is your verdict?'
</p>

<p>
'Guilty,' said Buckeye Joe, 'and we all say
it, and you might as well have heard us first as
last.'
</p>

<p>
'Do you all say "Guilty"?' demanded Bill,
ignoring the foreman.
</p>

<p>
'Yep, si, oui, ja, yes,' said the jury, 'by
crimes, we do, all of us, todos, tous, the hull
crowd unanimous.  And we sentences him to
death.'
</p>

<p>
'Rise up the prisoner,' said Bill, 'and the
jury can sit down and hold their blamed
tongues.  This isn't <i>lynchin'</i>; this is a Court
with a joodishul jedge.  If witherin' sarcasm
warn't lost on the lot of you, I'd tell you what
I think of your trespassin' upon my rights.
Rise up the prisoner.'
</p>

<p>
And Seth Graves 'rose' him up.
</p>

<p>
'Let me go, you damn fool,' said Bertie.
'How dare you?  You've no right to do it,
to make a fool of me.  Help! help!  I'm
not going to stay here and be jeered at.
Don't you touch me,' and he foamed at the
mouth.  Even Seth Graves found him hard to
freeze to.
</p>

<p>
'Hold on,' said Arizona, now without a smile.
'Mr. Bertie Fortescue, mebbe you think this is
a joke?  Well, so it is, in one way, but not in
the next.  Do you reckon it a joke?'
</p>

<p>
'No,' said Bertie, through his teeth.
</p>

<p>
'You're right,' said the judge, 'for at the
bottom, my son, it's tol'rable serious.  While
we've been takin' the evidence, I've been
considerin' my sentences.  I reckon one sentence
ain't enough, so I'll do my best to put a few
together.  For the sentence of this Court is
that you are to be told briefly and with a rasp
what I and the rest think of you, my son.
Silence, boys, there's somethin' actual
afterwards, and I'm goin' to hev peace while I
orate, or a few of you will go on deck in a
horse-sling.'
</p>

<p>
Arizona stood up, and there was a look in his
eye which produced order.  He turned again to
Bertie.
</p>

<p>
'You miserable young jackass,' said the
impartial and just judge.  'You miserable
young jackass, listen and l'arn.  We've been
good to you, I've been good to you, and by
my orders your life hez been spared.  You
kicked Seth Graves, you hoofed Ben Wilkins
in the ribs, you threatened to kick me, and if it
hadn't bin for a friend of yourn on board this
packet you'd ha' bin shot and thrown
overboard.  I wonder if you understand, my son,
that you're no one, that you're ignorant, that
you're as green and juicy as grass in rain.
Mebbe you never saw <i>men</i> before.  We're a
rough and tough crowd, we've lived our lives,
seen men die and taken chances ourselves,
though I own some of us are little better than
hoboes or tomayto-can vags, and you come
along flourishin' a gun (thishyer gun) that you
cayn't shoot with, and shoot off your mouth at
us!  By the great horn spoon, it's a marvel,
boys, ain't it?'
</p>

<p>
'That's so,' said the crowd seriously.
</p>

<p>
'Do you believe me, Bertie, when I tell you
straight that if I hadn't interfered you'd hev
been dead by now?' asked Bill as he sat down
again.
</p>

<p>
'No,' said Bertie.
</p>

<p>
Ben Wilkins got up and walked close to the
prisoner.
</p>

<p>
'Don't you?' asked Ben.  His eyes were like
furnaces.  'Don't you?'
</p>

<p>
'Stand back, Ben,' said Bill.  'My son, don't
you think you kin persuade yourself I speak the
trewth?'
</p>

<p>
There was a strange short silence.
</p>

<p>
'Speak,'said Bill.
</p>

<p>
'Ye&mdash;es,' said Bertie.
</p>

<p>
Bill nodded.
</p>

<p>
'Ah, I thought you'd see it, my son.  It's
true, it's truer than most gospel, as preached.
Why, you miserable galoot, what we thinks of
you is below words.  What do you know?
You know nothin'.  You reckon you know
"horse."  Let me tell that does, that you don't
know "horse," nor mewel, nor even jackass.
Your knowledge of horses is equal to your
knowledge of men.  Mebbe this'll teach you
some.  Your clothes don't make you a man,
nor your eyeglass.  You talked a while back
about mutiny!  Waal, I ain't an expert in
mutiny, but my notion is that the only
authority such as you possess is the authority
nat'ral to a man.  You've got none.  You
said you'd hev us all in gaol at Cape Town.
Some of us hev assaulted you, eh?  Well,
you assaulted some of us.  Is your opinion of
yourself ez high ez it was at supper-time, or hev
you come to the conclusion that you've suthin'
to l'arn?  I don't press for an answer, for I
reckon one ain't required.  You've been taken
down some, and we've done it serious, and
without violence, because you're a boy and
may be made a man of yet.  I ain't down on
Englishmen, like some is out West.  I know
good men Englishmen, real good.  But your
kind, when green, would rise the dander of a
peaceful cow.  The order of this Court is, that
your gun shall be throwed overboard, and that
you'll wear no real gun while we're here to
take care of you.  Ben, break up Bertie's nice
new gun, and do it now.'
</p>

<p>
Ben Wilkins smashed the stock of the
six-shooter on the iron coamings of the hatch,
and then broke the trigger.  He threw the
disorganised weapon into a muck-skip.
</p>

<p>
'Whose nice new gun has been taken away
and bust up?' asked Ben.
</p>

<p>
'Baby Bertie's nice new gun has,' said the
crowd.
</p>

<p>
'And now,' said Bill, 'to take the sting out
of these proceedings, we propose to present you
with a gun that cayn't do no harm.  Produce
the gun, Ben.'
</p>

<p>
And Ben produced a piece of wood shaped
roughly in the form of a six-shooter.
</p>

<p>
'We invests you with the order of the wooden
gun,' said Bill.  'And our advice to you is,
that you will treasure it and put it up in your
cabin and look at it daily till you come to
understand why we presented it.  From the
way you've took these proceedings since your
last fight to down Seth, which no man on
board can do, this Court and the rest of the
crowd hez hopes of you.  Boys, do I voice the
sentiments of this educational meetin' on the
orlop deck o' the <i>Pilgrim</i>, belonging to
Messrs. Fortescue and Son, when I say we all believe that
this collegiate course will eventuate in makin' a
man of Mr. Fortescue's son and heir?'
</p>

<p>
'You do,' said the unanimous crowd.  'We
hev high hopes of him.'
</p>

<p>
'Release the prisoner,' said Bill.  'And
this Court is dissolved into its constituent
individuals.'
</p>

<p>
And Bertie rose from the hatch, not knowing
where he was, or what he was, or who he was.
But of one thing he was quite certain.  He was
not the young man who came below an hour
before.  He walked away perfectly quietly, not
knowing that the wooden gun was suspended
from his shoulder by a string.
</p>

<p>
'Ah!' said Bertie.  He went through the
crowd as if he didn't see them, walked up the
brow to the 'tween-decks, and presently found
himself outside his cabin on the spar deck.  He
nodded and said 'ha,' and found the order of
the wooden gun.  He dropped it inside the
cabin and went for'ard to the bridge.  Old
Scantlebury waddled to him.
</p>

<p>
'Ain't it a lovely heavenly night, sir?' said
the 'old man.'  'And going along so peaceful,
while the stars shine on us.  Are the horses all
right, and the men?'
</p>

<p>
'They're&mdash;all right,' said Bertie.  He seemed
so silent that the skipper said no more.
</p>

<p>
'I wonder who Arizona meant when he said
a friend of mine,' thought Bertie.  'I'll&mdash;I'll
ask him.'
</p>

<p>
He went down below on the main deck
and found Arizona leaning on a breast-rail
and rubbing a big grey's muzzle.
</p>

<p>
'Arizona,' said Bertie.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, sir,' said Arizona.
</p>

<p>
'What friend of mine did you mean just now?'
</p>

<p>
Arizona looked at him.  The electric light
was strong there and fell on Bertie's face.  It
seemed quite different from what it had been.
Arizona looked him full in the eyes as if
nothing whatever had happened.
</p>

<p>
'It was the second mate, Mr. Forder, sir.'
</p>

<p>
'Why did he interfere?' asked Bertie.
</p>

<p>
'Well, sir,' said Arizona, 'he hez bin in
Texas and in Arizona, and he understands
things.'
</p>

<p>
Bertie turned away.
</p>

<p>
'He understands&mdash;what?'
</p>

<p>
'Us, I reckon,' said Arizona simply.
</p>

<p>
'Thanks,' said Bertie, and he went to the
second officer's room, and tapped at the door.
Forder opened to him, for he was reading.
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' he said, 'what is it?'
</p>

<p>
If he spoke without any audible tone of
respect, it was only what Bertie looked for.
</p>

<p>
'I'm sorry we had that trouble the other
day,' said the owner's son.  'I've had a talk
with Arizona.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't mention it,' said Forder.  'It's a
beautiful night, Mr. Fortescue.'
</p>

<p>
'It is,' said Bertie.  'Good night, Mr. Forder.'
</p>

<p>
'Good night, sir,' said the second officer.
</p>

<p>
And Bertie stood for half an hour by the
rail looking into the sea.
</p>

<p>
'Damn!' said Bertie, 'I don't know&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
But Arizona said there were hopes of him.

<h3>
CAPTAIN BALAAM OF THE <i>CORMORANT</i>
</h3>

<p>
Captain Balaam of the <i>Cormorant</i> was an
ignorant old fool.  Captain Benjamin Wood
of the <i>Scanderbeg</i> said so.  He was also
obstinate, ferocious, blatant, bigoted, and given
to liquor.  Captain Benjamin Wood said this
too.  The crew of the <i>Cormorant</i> agreed with
the crowd in the <i>Scanderbeg</i> that their skipper
was a disagreeable personality: they phrased
it differently, they said he was an adjectival
'blighter.'  And yet for all that there was
jealousy between the crews of the two ships,
just as there was jealousy between the two
skippers.  The only difference between them
was that the <i>Scanderbegs</i> believed in their ship
and their skipper and the <i>Cormorants</i> believed
in the <i>Cormorant</i> only.  Both vessels hailed
from the same port of registry; they both
traded to Australia, and mostly to Melbourne;
they were owned by related rivals, and manned
for the most part by men who knew each
others' home affairs.  It was no wonder that
when the <i>Cormorant</i> was re-masted, as she
had been previously under-sparred, the
<i>Scanderbeg's</i> crew was very greatly excited.  Up
to the present time their ship had made the
best passages, and now Balaam had announced
that he meant to lick the <i>Scanderbeg</i> by a
ruddy ensanguined crimson month.
</p>

<p>
'You're an ignorant old ass, and can't do it,'
said Captain Wood.
</p>

<p>
'I'm an ignorant old ass, am I?' retorted
Balaam, who was slow at <i>repartee</i>.  'I'll show
you!'
</p>

<p>
'I expect you will,' said Wood.  'I know
you, Balaam.'
</p>

<p>
'You know me, do you?' said Balaam.
'Do you know anything against me?  I
despise you, Wood; I despise you.  You
shortened sail mighty quick that time we
was in company off the Leuuwin.  Oh yes,
you 'anded that foretaups'l mighty quick, and
I 'eld on to mine.'
</p>

<p>
'You'll not do it now the <i>Cormorant</i> has
some real spars in her,' retorted Wood.  'You
know, according to your own account, you
could never put enough on her to do her any
harm in a cyclone.'
</p>

<p>
'I never,' said Balaam; 'but any'ow this
time I'll lick your ugly 'ead off.  It don't
foller because a man's full of scientific talk
that 'e's a seaman.  Great circles and double
haltitudes and star hobservations make me sick!'
</p>

<p>
'They'd make you sick to work 'em out,'
said Wood.  'When you got your ship
resparred you might have got a new set of
brains, Balaam.'
</p>

<p>
And he left Balaam foaming at the mouth
as an old timber drogher foams under bluff
bows with a whole gale behind her.
</p>

<p>
They left London River the same day, and
lost sight of each other in the chops of the
Channel.  But since destiny was playing with
them they lay close together under the Line
for the best part of a fortnight in a dead
calm.  The <i>Cormorant</i> was the first to draw
away in a series of light flaws, which were
really the northern edge of the South-East
Trade, and Balaam signalled to Wood: 'I'll
report you!'
</p>

<p>
'Confound it, she's a wonder in light airs,'
said Wood.  'But what she'll be in bad
weather will settle it.  I don't give in; not
much.'
</p>

<p>
They ran across each other once more to
the south of the Cape, and both ships had a
first-class opportunity of showing what they
could do in heavy weather.
</p>

<p>
'I'll run her under before I'll shorten sail,'
said Wood.
</p>

<p>
'Blimy,' said Balaam, 'before I shorten down
I'll 'ave the new sticks out of her.'
</p>

<p>
Mr. Briggs, the chief mate, implored him
to go a bit easy.  'She's new to it, sir, and
we're not settled down and set up the way
she should be yet.'
</p>

<p>
'I'll show you,' said Balaam.  'If she ain't
what she should be it's your fault.  You're
the mate, ain't you?'
</p>

<p>
But if the mate is responsible for the rigging
the skipper is responsible for trying it, and
Balaam drank hard and tried it high.
</p>

<p>
'I'd rather fetch into Hobson's Bay under
jury rig than let that swine lick us,' said
Balaam thickly.  'Mr. Briggs, h'ist that
main-t'gall'ns'l over the reefed taups'l and let her
scoot!'
</p>

<p>
If they hadn't once more lost each other in
a screaming south-easter the catastrophe might
have come right then.  It was only when the
<i>Scanderbeg</i> was swallowed up in thick weather
and the night that Balaam got so drunk that
Briggs ventured to shorten sail.
</p>

<p>
'I wish he'd keep drunk,' said Briggs
bitterly to the second greaser.
</p>

<p>
'Ah, his bein' only squiffy is very tryin', sir,'
replied Mr. Creak.  'It strikes me, sir, that
the men are gettin' disgruntled at the way
he keeps things goin'.  They're beginnin' to
want a lot of driving.'
</p>

<p>
'Then drive 'em,' said Briggs shortly.  He
was being driven himself.
</p>

<p>
The crowd for'ard were really very sore
about everything.  They had no particular
grievance; that is, they only had seamen's
grievances.  The vessel was undermanned.
Well, all British ships are.  What's the good
of an Englishman if he can't do more than
any one else?  They were, of course, badly
fed.  That was nothing: nothing even that it
steadily grew worse.  What hurt them was
Balaam's way of looking at them.  An Italian
might have said he had the evil eye.  They
didn't mind his evil tongue.  The truth is
that Balaam was sand in their bearings; they
got hot to think of him.  They compared him
with Captain Wood.
</p>

<p>
'That's a man,' said Charlie Baker; 'a real
one.'
</p>

<p>
'You're over young to go so large about
men, my son,' remarked Smith, a grey-haired
veteran who had served his time in the Western
Ocean; 'but I allow that Cap'n Wood is all
there.  When he was launched he was classed
100 A1 and no mistake.'
</p>

<p>
'With a broad A for iron and a Maltee Cross
for built under special survey,' added Tom
Paddle, who hailed from Newcastle, and had
worked in a shipbuilding yard.
</p>

<p>
'I never heard of no Maltee Cross connected
with ships,' said old Smith.
</p>

<p>
This raised an argument which lasted for
the best part of an hour and ended in Paddle
being put down by a unanimous vote, though
he shouted as loudly as possible.
</p>

<p>
'You must be wrong,' urged his particular
mate.  'Don't you 'ear we're all agin you?'
</p>

<p>
'I'll fight on it,' said Paddle fiercely.
</p>

<p>
''Ow could a scrap settle it?' asked Smith
contemptuously.  'Suppose you and Baker
fo't over it and you knocked Charlie out, would
that make black white?'
</p>

<p>
'Then 'ow the devil is a man to know the
truth of anything,' said Paddle pathetically.
</p>

<p>
It was the first argument of his that the
rest owned had some sense in it.  But the
row blew over, as rows do in the fo'c'sle, and
they abused the skipper till eight bells.
</p>

<p>
But if the row blew over it was more than
the gale did.  It lasted for forty-eight hours
and was followed by another.  The way Balaam
carried sail made every sober man shake.  That
year, and at that season, running down the
easting was no joke.  And as Balaam knew the
<i>Scanderbeg</i> would go as far south as possible
on the Composite Great Circle Track he did likewise.
</p>

<p>
'Gawd's treuth,' said Charlie Baker, who was
a joker, 'I've 'eard tell of the brave west winds,
but these 'ere are puffectly reckless 'eroes!'
</p>

<p>
Old Balaam stumped the weather side of the
poop, or hung on to the weather mizzen
rigging and bawled&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Let her scoot; what she can't carry&mdash;hic&mdash;she
may drag.  Mister Briggs&mdash;hic&mdash;shake
out a reef in the main taups'l; I smells the
cookin' on board the <i>Scanderbeg</i>, what ho!'
</p>

<p>
'Good Lord,' said Briggs.  And Mr. Creak
said so too.
</p>

<p>
'We'll be crawlin' into Hobson's Bay yet
under a jury rig,' both mates agreed.  They
prophesied sadly, gloomily; and they prophesied right.
</p>

<p>
'The <i>Scanderbeg</i> will lick us by months,'
they said.  Here they prophesied wrong, for the
<i>Scanderbeg</i> was a hundred miles only to the
south'ard, and the same gale that was destined
to whip the sticks out of the <i>Cormorant</i> was
worse the further south it blew.  They were
then in latitude 45° S. and longitude 56° W.,
and the Crozets were on their starboard quarter.
The real gale started at N.W. like a perfect
fiend, grew into a hurricane from the west
with the centre of the disturbance to the
south-'ard, and when it passed away with frightful
squalls into a steady sou'wester, the <i>Cormorant</i>
was lying head to wind, anchored to part of
her own wreckage, and she hadn't a feather
to fly with.  Captain Balaam went below and
called to the steward.
</p>

<p>
'Bunting, rum!' said Balaam, and Bunting,
who was as white as spindrift with terror,
brought it.  Balaam went to sleep calmly, and
left matters to Briggs and Creak.  The worst
having come to the worst, being left to
themselves, they proved to be men.  They had
something to do and did it.  They cut all the
wreck adrift and rigged a proper sea-anchor
and repaired damages as best they could.  But
they couldn't repair the damage done to the
provisions.  The whole of the front of the poop
had been burst in by the sea, and a big hole
driven by the mizzen-topmast into the deck
right through the poop and main deck into
the lazarette.  Into that there went so much
water that anything not in tins was unfit to
eat.  And now all the pork and beef, save that
in the harness casks, was found to be rotten.
</p>

<p>
'Great Scott!' said Briggs.  The crew of the
<i>Cormorant</i> anticipated starvation and had huge
appetites.  But they bore up well.  A day
ahead is enough for men of the sea.  Charlie
Baker took hold of the boys and felt them all
over to see if they were fat.  The others
thought it an admirable joke.  The boys were
not so sure that it was.
</p>

<p>
'Never mind, mates,' said Baker, 'a boy will
go a long way, and we 'ave three!  But I
wonder 'ow the <i>Scanderbeg</i> is makin' it?'
</p>

<p>
There is something peculiarly diabolical at
times in the way of the sea.  It was a
coincidence, though perhaps an ordinary one, that
the poor <i>Scanderbeg</i> was just then wallowing
at a sea-anchor a hundred miles to the south
of them, with nothing but the stumps of her
masts to show a rag on.  But it was a far more
extraordinary coincidence that her crew were
in danger of starvation.  As Captain Wood
did not drink, his steward did.  It seems
necessary that some one shall at sea, and though it
is usually the skipper, who has no one to
control him, it excites no surprise to find that
the steward does.  This particular specimen
of a hard-worked individual went into the
lazarette with an uncovered candle, sampled
some rum, which was forty over proof, and
fell asleep to wake in a world where we are
led to believe drink is scarce, though smoking
is permitted.  And the <i>Scanderbeg</i> was on fire
just when the wind from the N.W. and a
falling barometer announced the approach of
a hurricane.
</p>

<p>
The fire was put out and the steward dragged
out, but what with fire and smoke and water
combined, the provisions he had charge of
were no more likely to do their duty than he
was.  They put him overboard gloomily, and
that night the hurricane fell on them and did
its worst.
</p>

<p>
'Well,' said poor Captain Wood, 'I'm afraid
the <i>Cormorant</i> will beat us this time!'
</p>

<p>
But he did not take to drink and camp in a
wet bunk as Balaam did.  He worked day and
night with his two mates, and made some sort
of a show with a jury rig inside of twenty-four
hours.  But he was very much troubled about
the 'grub.'  Ships are never over-provisioned,
and even the stock of canned goods had been
fired and fuzed.
</p>

<p>
'I'd give fifty pounds for a ton of biscuits,'
said Wood.
</p>

<p>
It wasn't till they were under way again
and doing nearly four knots an hour with the
sou'wester behind them, that an idea struck him.
</p>

<p>
'By Jove,' said the skipper.  He slapped his
thigh and suddenly became cheerful.  Mr. Boden,
the chief mate, was very curious but
did not express his curiosity.
</p>

<p>
'The old man has something in his mind,'
he told the second greaser, Tom Hankin.
</p>

<p>
'I wish I had something in my stomach,'
said Hankin.
</p>

<p>
And the skipper went below.  When he came
up he altered the course to E.N.E., and Boden
having taken a squint at the chart, became
much more cheerful.  So did Hankin, though
he tightened his belt.  So did the crowd for'ard,
though they tightened theirs.
</p>

<p>
And the next day they ran across the <i>Cormorant</i>
in that almighty waste of grey storm.
</p>

<p>
'Blimy,' said the crew, 'maybe we'll get
some toke from this 'ere 'ooker wot's 'ad the
syme misforchune as ourselves.  I wonder what
she is?'
</p>

<p>
So did Wood, and when he found out he
would have been much more than human if
he had not been pleased, though he had not
read La Rochefoucauld.
</p>

<p>
'She won't lick us into Melbourne after all,'
said the skipper.
</p>

<p>
He hove the poor old <i>Scanderbeg</i> to under
the lee of the <i>Cormorant</i>, and she lay wallowing
comfortably under a rag of a faked-up trysail
and the head of a staysail showing on her
forestay.  Wood bellowed to windward with a
speaking-trumpet, 'Where's Captain Balaam?'
</p>

<p>
Poor Briggs was tired and cross and insubordinate
in his mind.
</p>

<p>
'In his bunk,' came down the wind.
</p>

<p>
'Is he hurt?'
</p>

<p>
'Drunk, sir,' said the distant voice.
</p>

<p>
'What did he say?' asked Wood of his mate.
</p>

<p>
'He said Captain Balaam was drunk, sir.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah,' said the skipper.  He asked no more
about Balaam, but inquired if they could let
him have some provisions.  The answer he
got was rather a blow.  But it was not so
much of a blow to him as the question had
been to Briggs.
</p>

<p>
'We're starving already,' bellowed Briggs
forlornly to the wind, and the sea and the
wreck to loo'ard of him.
</p>

<p>
'When will you get sail on her, d' ye think?'
asked Wood.
</p>

<p>
'To-morrow,' replied Briggs.
</p>

<p>
'Make for St. Paul,' said Wood; 'provisions
are stored there, so I see in the Directory.
We'll share 'em!'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks,' said the other speaking-trumpet.
And then silence fell between these two partners
of the sea in high misfortune.
</p>

<p>
'She's really not so badly crippled as we
are,' said Wood.
</p>

<p>
And that was true; so true, that on the
morrow the <i>Cormorant</i> crept out of the waste
of tumbling seas and the gloom of the grey
dawn and wallowed past them.  Balaam was
on deck dancing.
</p>

<p>
'Licking thunder out of you, you dog,' was
his polite message of thanks to the <i>Scanderbeg</i>.
'Crippled or all ataunto, we can knock spots
off of your old barge.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, he's a gentleman,' said Wood.  'We
won't reply.'
</p>

<p>
'I'm sorry he's likely to get to the island
first, sir,' put in his mate.  'I'd not be
surprised if he grabbed all there is to get, sir.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh no, surely,' said Wood.  But though he
said so, the notion bit into him and made him all
the more anxious to get more sail on her.  He
worked with the men like one of them, and
only slept two hours out of the twenty-four.
</p>

<p>
'He's a bully old man,' said his hungry
crew: 'the best skipper we ever sailed with.
Oh, but ain't we 'ungry!'
</p>

<p>
They were hungrier yet when they sighted
the crater of St. Paul and rounded to on the
north-east coast opposite the broken entrances
to the inner crater harbour.  They anchored
in deep water, and so long as the wind stayed
west of south were in perfect safety.  But there
was no <i>Cormorant</i> in sight.
</p>

<p>
'By Jove,' said Wood, 'she's missed it after
all.  I'm not surprised.  Balaam's no navigator.
Called me a dog, did he?  Well, I've
smelt my way here and he's out of it.'
</p>

<p>
The crew were joyful and excited.  This was
something new, something a little out of the
way in the dull, dead monotony of sea-life,
which as a rule is about as interesting as
running a water-cart up and down a suburban
road.  The august and awful sea is only
august and awful for those who have august
minds.  Seamen as a rule haven't; they have
only awful language.
</p>

<p>
'Blow me tight,' said Bill Waite from
Shadwell.  'I sye, this is a gyme!  Sye, Tom,
let's desert and live 'ere for hever and make
a farm!'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, let's,' said his mate, Fred Day.  'If
it's anythin' like the Canary Bird Islands, it'll
be a fine farm for sulphur and cinders.  What
I want is the grub, and get out of it.  Give
me Sandridge and a pot of she-oak.'
</p>

<p>
They went ashore, pulling in through the
crater entrance, and were surrounded by gloomy
walls nearly a thousand feet high.
</p>

<p>
''Tain't exactly as bloomin' as the Isle of
Man,' said Bill, 'at least not on a Benk 'oliday.
Where's the grub, d'ye think?'
</p>

<p>
They found out where it was very soon.  At
least, they considered they were able to deduce
from the facts in front of them where it was.
The rude stone and lava hut in which it had
been stored stared them almost in the face.
But it was odd, they said, that the door was
open.
</p>

<p>
When Mr. Briggs reached it he turned round
and looked very much disturbed.  So did the
hut.  It had been disturbed recently, and there
wasn't as much as the smell of a biscuit left
in it.
</p>

<p>
'The <i>Cormorant</i> has been here and taken it
all,' said Briggs.  You could have knocked the
boat's crew down with much less than a belaying
pin.  They collapsed upon adjacent blocks
of lava and said things not fit for publication
except in realistic novels.
</p>

<p>
'The swine,' sighed Charlie Baker.  'Oh,
ain't there nothin', sir?'
</p>

<p>
'Not a thing,' said the mate.  He led the
way back to the boat, and under the wondering
eye of the skipper, which was just then glued
to a telescope, they embarked and rowed back
like a funeral procession.
</p>

<p>
'Captain Balaam has taken all the provisions,
sir,' said the mate.
</p>

<p>
'All?'
</p>

<p>
'Every biscuit, sir.'
</p>

<p>
'Get the anchor up and make sail,' said the
skipper.  He went below, and when he came
on deck again the <i>Scanderbeg</i> was standing out
to sea.
</p>

<p>
'Muster the men aft, Mr. Briggs,' said
Captain Wood.  And when they came aft the
old man addressed them.  The pith of his
address lay in the tail of it.
</p>

<p>
'We must catch the <i>Cormorant</i>,' he said.
And the men said they would if human hands
could get enough sail on their old wreck to
catch the robber and scoundrel, then
somewhere to the east of them.  Men and mates
and the skipper took their coats off.  They
clapped make-shift sails on every stay till the
<i>Scanderbeg</i> looked like a laundry drying-yard.
They got up another jurymast made of the
fished halves of the main topmast.  They made
her four knots into five, into five and a quarter,
into five and a half, and then they lay down at
midnight and dreamed of eating.
</p>

<p>
They sighted the <i>Cormorant</i> ahead of them
two days later.
</p>

<p>
'There she is, the thief,' said the men.  As
the weather was now finer and dry, they wetted
their rags of canvas so that the sails held a
little more wind; they rigged up more canvas
yet by lacing it to the foot of their foresail,
which did most of the work.  They hung out
their clothes to dry, and tied them so that the
very shirts held wind.
</p>

<p>
'All right, my sons,' said the crowd of the
<i>Scanderbeg</i>, 'wait till we catch you.'
</p>

<p>
They drew up with her at dark.  The weather
was moderating fast, the heavy sea went down
rapidly: the wind fell light, and stars shone
through the breaking canopy of clouds.  The
<i>Scanderbeg</i> drew up on the <i>Cormorant's</i>
starboard quarter slowly.  It was obvious that in
her present trim she could out-sail the other
vessel anyhow, and this in spite of the fact
that Briggs had made good use of his spare
topmast.  The <i>Scanderbeg</i> had none.  It had
broken from its lashings, and gone overboard
like a match out of an emptied pail when she
was nearly under water and came up out of
the smother like a diver.
</p>

<p>
The crew of the <i>Scanderbeg</i> were on the
fo'c'slehead.
</p>

<p>
'Will he run aboard of 'em?  By crimes,
there'll be ructions,' said Bill Waite dancing.
'Oh, the miserable dogs; oh, the scum o' the
seas; oh, the pirates!'
</p>

<p>
'Dry up, you ass,' said his mate.  'The
skipper's goin' to 'ail 'er!'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Cormorant</i>, ahoy!' said Captain Wood, who
came for'ard to the t'gallant fo'c'sle.  'Cormorant, ahoy!'
</p>

<p>
'Hallo!' said Briggs from the poop.
</p>

<p>
'What made you take all the provisions, Mr. Briggs?'
</p>

<p>
'The captain's orders, sir,' said poor Briggs,
who was obviously ashamed of himself and his
ship.  'I couldn't help it, sir.'
</p>

<p>
The two moving wrecks were now almost alongside.
</p>

<p>
'Clew up the foresail, Mr. Hankin,' said
Captain Wood.
</p>

<p>
The sail was clewed up, and now the
<i>Cormorant</i> drew a little ahead.
</p>

<p>
'I want to see Captain Balaam,' said Wood.
'Is he drunk now?'
</p>

<p>
The night was suddenly dark, and the figures
of the speakers barely distinguishable.
Nevertheless those on the fo'c'slehead of the
<i>Scanderbeg</i> were aware that Briggs suddenly
disappeared and was replaced by some one else.
</p>

<p>
'I'm not drunk, you swab,' hiccuped Captain
Balaam.  It was a very obvious misstatement
on his part.  'I'm not drunk, you miserable
howler.  There warn't enough grub for one,
let alone two, so I collared the lot.'
</p>

<p>
A voice was heard from his ship which contradicted him.
</p>

<p>
'That's a lie.  There was plenty for both!'
</p>

<p>
Balaam left the poop hurriedly and was heard
inquiring for the mutineer who dared to put
his oar in at such a time.  Every man jack
on the main-deck protested it was not he.
</p>

<p>
'Very well,' said Balaam, 'when I find who
it is, I'll hammer him flat, flat!  I'll massacre him!'
</p>

<p>
He came back to the poop and resumed his
talk with Wood.
</p>

<p>
'Not enough for two&mdash;hic&mdash;and if there was
you shouldn't have it.  I'll give you a bag
of split peas!'
</p>

<p>
The men in the <i>Scanderbeg</i> groaned.  They
had been living on split peas for three days.
Bill Waite signified what he thought of the
offer by taking an iron belaying pin from the
rail and throwing it at old Balaam.  It was a
good shot, but the distance was too great.  It hit
the rail of the <i>Cormorant</i> and fell into the sea.
</p>

<p>
'Split peas,' said Fred Day; 'oh, lor'!
What'll our old man say to that?'
</p>

<p>
Wood was a gentleman, and he very rarely
used bad language.  There are times, however,
when language to do any good to the user must
be bad, and Wood told Balaam what he
thought of him.  He ran the <i>Scanderbeg</i> close
up alongside until Balaam thought he was
going to be boarded, and then addressed
him.  His crew roared with applause and
hissed Balaam furiously.  They called him
every horrible thing they could think of, and
Charlie Baker said 'Hear, hear' from the
<i>Cormorant's</i> main-deck.
</p>

<p>
'It ain't our fault, maties,' he cried.  'Old
Balaam's a cock-eyed blighter!'
</p>

<p>
But Wood roared, 'Silence fore and aft,' and
spoke once more.
</p>

<p>
'Will you divide the provisions, Captain
Balaam?  I ask you for the last time.'
</p>

<p>
'I'll see you sunk, burnt, and destroyed and
doubly damned if I will,' said Balaam.  'I
'ates you, and don't hown to no obligation to
you.  You never was polite nor friendly.  Now
you're repentin'.  You may go to blazes by
express.  My name's Balaam.  I'm captain of
this ship, and don't take horders from a scientific
lubber like you.  I ain't drunk&mdash;hic&mdash;though
you say so.  I'm as sober as a missionary,
quite sober&mdash;hic&mdash;and hif you incites my crew
to mutiny I'll sue you for damages and justice
in Melbourne.  Mr. Briggs, make sail, crack on!'
</p>

<p>
He retired to a hencoop and sent for the
steward.
</p>

<p>
'Bunting, gimme a drop o' brandy and gin
mixed with a dash o' rum in it,' said Balaam.
</p>

<p>
It was his favourite drink.
</p>

<p>
But in the <i>Scanderbeg</i> Wood was talking
to Mr. Boden.
</p>

<p>
'All right, Mr. Boden,' said he, 'set the
foresail and let us draw ahead.  I'll not put
up with this.  We shall be starving in reality
in three days.  We'll get even as soon as ever
the sea goes down.'
</p>

<p>
And somehow it got to the men for'ard that
the situation was not to last.  They ate pease
pudding with loathing and smoked heavily.
</p>

<p>
'We relies on the old man,' they said.  'Oh,
what a blighter old Balaam is.'
</p>

<p>
They kept a mile or two ahead of the <i>Cormorant</i>
all that day, and when night fell again
the sea was fairly calm and the sky clear.
</p>

<p>
'We've got three boats fit to go over the
side,' said the skipper to Boden.  'Get 'em
ready, and now it's dark you can have 'em
swung out.  Belaying pins will do.'
</p>

<p>
What belaying pins would do for soon
appeared, when the skipper had the men
mustered aft.
</p>

<p>
'Men,' he said, 'all the food which should
have been divided is now on board the
<i>Cormorant</i>, Captain Balaam, who is no gentleman&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'He ain't no seaman neither, sir,' said Bill
Waite.  The others told him to dry up, and
he subsided, blushing at his own audacity.
</p>

<p>
'And I propose to board his vessel and
compel him to divide it.'
</p>

<p>
'Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!' said the crowd.
'Oh, ain't this somethin' like!'
</p>

<p>
'If there is any resistance,' went on Wood,
'it must be put down.  For that purpose each
of you will take a belaying pin, but you will
leave your knives behind.  In half an hour I
shall shorten sail and man the boats.  You will
all keep silence.  I shall go with you myself to
see that no unnecessary violence is used.
Mr. Hankin, you will remain on board with two
of the boys.'
</p>

<p>
As there were three boys it is unnecessary to
state that there was an almost immediate fight
to see who were to stay.  Both who did were
much more damaged next morning than the
victim who went.
</p>

<p>
At midnight the foresail was clewed up and
a few more of the make-shift sails furled.  The
boats were lowered safely, and in ten minutes
the <i>Scanderbeg</i> was only manned by a sorry
second mate and two sore boys.  The vessel
moved off slowly into the starry darkness,
looking like a huge house-boat converted into
a laundry.  To the westward the <i>Cormorant</i>
loomed darkly.  She grew slowly as they waited
in perfect silence.
</p>

<p>
'This will be a lesson to Balaam,' said
Captain Wood across the quiet sea to Boden.
'I hope, I sincerely hope, that he is not drunk,
Mr. Boden!'
</p>

<p>
'Gosh, we're pirates of the deep,' said Waite,
and the men in his boat chuckled.
</p>

<p>
'Silence in your boat, Waite,' said the
skipper.  And as the <i>Cormorant</i> drew nearer
and nearer the boats divided.  The skipper's
boat and Waite's lay ready to board her on
the starboard side.  Boden was to rush her
on the port.  Now they heard the very lip
of the seas against her bows.  Her broken
spars stood up against the sky.  They heard
a voice aft.  Some one struck one bell on board
of her.  The man on the look-out sleepily said
that it was 'All well!'  And now her bows
were above them.  They pulled a stroke and
her sides loomed high.
</p>

<p>
'Hook on,' said the skipper, and before the
<i>Cormorant</i> knew it she was seized by what
Waite called 'the pirates of the deep.'
</p>

<p>
'She's ours,' said Waite as he jumped on
deck and found no one to oppose him.  In
half a minute there wasn't a soul in the boats,
which promptly went adrift.  Mr. Briggs, who
was the officer of the watch, was an unreluctant
prisoner in the hands of Captain Wood.
</p>

<p>
'I couldn't stand it, you see,' said Wood,
as he shook hands.
</p>

<p>
'I ain't a bit surprised,' replied Briggs; 'in
fact, I rather reckoned you'd not put up with it.'
</p>

<p>
'Fetch up Balaam,' said Wood.  And Balaam
was brought up.  By this time the two crews,
who were no longer jealous of each other,
were standing together on the main deck on
the friendliest terms.
</p>

<p>
'You're our prisoners,' said Waite cheerfully.
And the crew of the <i>Cormorant</i> laughed,
while Balaam bellowed like a bull on the poop.
</p>

<p>
'It's piracy, rank piracy,' roared Balaam,
as he struggled in the grasp of Boden and
his enemy, the skipper of the <i>Scanderbeg</i>.
'This is piracy, and you'll be 'ung for it!'
</p>

<p>
They slammed him down upon a hencoop
with considerable violence.
</p>

<p>
'Dry up, you old thief,' said Boden.  'You
ought to be ashamed of yourself.  If you don't
stop kicking I'll land you on the jaw.'
</p>

<p>
He shook Balaam till his teeth chattered
and he called on Mr. Briggs for help.  Briggs
turned his back to him and walked to the rail
on the port side of the poop.
</p>

<p>
'We've come for those provisions, Captain
Balaam,' said Wood, 'and we mean to have them.'
</p>

<p>
'You're a pirate,' said Balaam thickly, 'oh,
you're a pirate.'
</p>

<p>
'And you're a miserable, cowardly thief,'
replied Wood.  'I don't propose to argue with
you.  Mr. Boden, when we come up alongside
the <i>Scanderbeg</i>, shorten sail and we'll wait till
daylight.'
</p>

<p>
'You're givin' orders in my ship,' said
Balaam.  'Oh, this is horrid, it's a nightmare;
it ain't real!  I must be dreamin'!'
</p>

<p>
He yelled horribly, and it took three men
to hold him.  One of them was his own second
mate, who hated him venomously.
</p>

<p>
'If you make much more row, sir,' said
Creak, 'they'll put you over the side.  I heard
'em say so!'
</p>

<p>
'Did they, Mr. Creak?' whispered Balaam.
</p>

<p>
'They did,' said Creak.
</p>

<p>
'This is horrid, Creak.  Oh, Creak, am I
dreamin'?  Pinch me, so's I shall know.'
</p>

<p>
And Creak gave him a nip that drew a shriek
from him.
</p>

<p>
'You've took a piece out, confound you,'
said Balaam.
</p>

<p>
'I'm very sorry, sir,' said the second greaser,
with a pleased smile.  'But you ain't dreamin',
and the pirates down on the main-deck are
very savage against you.  I'd give up the grub
quickly.'
</p>

<p>
'Would you?' asked Balaam.
</p>

<p>
'I would, sir,' said Creak.  'Paddle whispered
to me just now that they had fixed it up to
hang you, and Captain Wood too if he objected.'
</p>

<p>
And Balaam, whose sobriety was returning
under the stress, lost his courage as his alcohol
evaporated.
</p>

<p>
'I'd beg their pardon, if I was you,' said
Creak.  'It's horrid being hung.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, yes,' said Balaam.  'Tell 'em they
can have the grub quite quiet.  I'd&mdash;I'd like
to go below.  Creak, I feel cold.'
</p>

<p>
And Creak was allowed to lead him to his
cabin.  When he got there, he locked himself
in, and piled all his possessions against the
door.  He fell into his bunk shivering, and
when he slept he dreamed horrible dreams,
which were the offspring of terror and alcohol.
He sobbed and said, 'Nobody loves me!'  He
came near to seeing rats.
</p>

<p>
And in the meantime the two vessels lay
alongside within a cable's length of each other,
while Waite and Boden used one of the
<i>Cormorant's</i> boats to pick up their own.  The
cook of the <i>Cormorant</i> was busy in the galley,
and the crew of the <i>Scanderbeg</i> ate a square
meal the first time for ten days.
</p>

<p>
'This is much better than split peas,' said
Bill Waite.  'I shall loathe peas all my life.
I don't know which I despise most, Balaam or
pease pudding.  Mates, it must be a horrid
thing to have such a skipper as Balaam.'
</p>

<p>
The men of the <i>Cormorant</i> said it was horrid.
</p>

<p>
'He's a cock-eyed blighter,' said Tom
Paddle, 'and I most willingly would see you
pirates 'ang him.  And as for the grub we
parts with, what belongs to you comes without
grudgin'.'
</p>

<p>
It was very handsome of Tom Paddle.  But
he was known to be generous even when he
was sober.  He helped to transfer the provisions
to the <i>Scanderbeg</i> with the heartiest good-will.
When the transhipment was made, all
the officers of both vessels breakfasted on board
the <i>Cormorant</i>, while Balaam lay in his bunk
hungry, not daring to call for anything.
</p>

<p>
'I know Wood will 'ang me,' he whimpered.
Without brandy, he had to believe it.
</p>

<p>
'While I am a pirate, Mr. Briggs,' said
Captain Wood pleasantly, 'I may as well carry
it out.  Can you spare me a coil of three-inch
manilla?'
</p>

<p>
'With pleasure,' said Briggs.  'Is there
anything else, sir?'
</p>

<p>
'What do you say, Mr. Boden?' asked Wood.
</p>

<p>
'I think we could do with half a dozen
stunsail booms,' said Boden.
</p>

<p>
'I rather want them myself,' said Briggs
anxiously.
</p>

<p>
But Wood was a good pirate, and did not
weaken.
</p>

<p>
'I think we want them more than you do,'
said Wood with firmness.  And he got them.
Briggs was sore, but said nothing.
</p>

<p>
'Is there anything else you would like?' he
asked with some natural bitterness.
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' said Wood, 'I think we'll take all
Balaam's sea-stock of liquor.  It will do him
good.'
</p>

<p>
'I haven't the least objection to that,' said
Briggs.
</p>

<p>
And half an hour afterwards the <i>Scanderbeg</i>
made sail, and forged slowly ahead of the
<i>Cormorant</i> on her way to Albany.
</p>

<p>
'We'll report you,' said Wood.
</p>

<p>
But when he was nearly out of sight, old
Balaam pulled down his fortifications and came
on deck, looking like a man who by a miracle
has shaved what are known as the 'jimjams.'
He sat down and wailed for Bunting.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, sir,' said Bunting.
</p>

<p>
'I think I'll have some brandy and gin with
a dash of rum in it,' said Balaam.
</p>

<p>
The steward looked at Mr. Briggs and grinned.
</p>

<p>
'If you please, sir, you can't, them pirates
took it all,' said Bunting.
</p>

<h3>
JACK-ALL-ALONE
</h3>

<p>
As it happened, I was the only passenger in
the steamship <i>Hindoo</i>, and I found little
entertainment in the company of her officers.  The
skipper was said never to open his mouth
except upon Sundays, when he preached
furiously to the assembled crowd and promised
them hell as a reward for their labours on the
deep sea.  He was a religious maniac, much
in favour with the owners because he combined
religion with honesty and an unequalled degree
of meanness about stores.  He was little, and
of a pallor that no sun could touch.  He
carried a hymn-book in his breast-pocket, and
loose snuff in a side one.  I found no comfort
in him, and even less in the two mates.  They
were much married men with large families,
and were subdued by the fear of losing their
billets.  They hung together and abused the
skipper, and took no interest in the sea or
any of its works.  They pined for inland farms,
where they would have been pelicans in a
dry desert.  I turned to the crew, and by dint
of giving them tobacco and occasional nips of
liquor overcame their distrust and shyness.
For even though I had once been a seaman,
that time was so far away that I had lost all
look of it.  And even when they knew it, they
took it for granted I had been an officer, which
put me out of their range.  It was only my
loneliness and my low cunning with rare
whisky that made me free of their company,
and at last loosened their tongues.  I often
sat with them in the dog-watches and set them
yarning when I could by yarning myself.  But
only one story that I heard remains in my
memory.  It remains, not so much by its
strangeness as by the strange way it was told,
and the difficulty I had in getting it told at all.
It was one of the younger seamen that put
me on the tracks of the man who had it to tell.
</p>

<p>
'Why don't you try old Silent for a yarn,
sir?' he said one day, when I was on the
fo'castlehead with him on the look-out; 'he
that says nought could say a lot.  He might
open up with you.  With us he's as close as
a water-tight compartment.  But they do say
in this vessel that he came out of one ship
the honly survivor.'

What can one do on board a lonely steamer
where there is no one to talk to and nothing
to read, and there are so many unoccupied
hours in front of one?  The days were grey,
the sea was grey, and as flat as last year's
news.  I set out yarn-hunting, and went for
old Silent as they called him.  I went for him
warily.  To ask him a question would be to
cheat oneself of any expectation.  I ceased
to attempt to talk with him.  But having fallen
into his mood, I added to the compliment by
giving him more tobacco on the quiet than
I gave any one else.  I called him into my
deck cabin, and gave him a drink of whisky
without a word.  He drank it without a word,
wiped his lips, scraped a sort of bow, and
withdrew.
</p>

<p>
He was a melancholy man, downcast, ragged-bearded,
with a glazed, yellow skin on his face,
and shining scales upon the backs of his hands.
His teeth were black with tobacco-chewing.
His ears had been pierced for earrings, though
he wore none.  His eyes were deep-set, black;
his mouth was a mere slit, his ears large and
outstanding, like a couple of stunsails.  He
was obviously strong even yet.  But he
assuredly bore the marks of certain disastrous
hours upon him, and his nerves betrayed him
at times.  I saw his hand shake when he
lifted the drink to his lips.
</p>

<p>
'You've been through something, my friend,'
I said to myself.  'I wonder what it is.  It's
not only "D.T."'
</p>

<p>
Life to my mind is a series of fights, and
one is mostly knocked out.  I could see that
old Silent had been knocked out.  Well, so
had I, many a time, and his gloomy face
appealed to me as a man of like disasters to
myself.  I saw (ay, and see) so many who
seem to have no kind of insight into things.
They are mere children, and one pities them
as one does young recruits going to war.  I've
known men to die without suspecting it.  For
the most part, men live without suspecting
any of the dangers, traps, pitfalls, and disasters
that surround them.  There was an uneasy
alertness at times in this old seaman's eye
which suggested that he knew Death was
close at hand.  I watched him keenly enough,
for I had a great curiosity about him.  What
was the story of this poor inhabitant of this
strange globe?  What had he in common with
those who see through illusion, who can pierce
the hollow earth and see the fires, who can
foretell storms, who can scent immediate and
irremediable death?
</p>

<p>
This was folly, no doubt.  I was in a bad
state of mind, and had disaster behind me, and
the shadow of it before me.  There have been
hours in many a man's life when the thought
that he could end it was his only comfort.
Without being in that state, my frame of mind
was not wholly enviable, and I wanted some
kind of help that I could not find.  What was
it that sent me to old Silent, if not the
intuition that he had known worse than I?
</p>

<p>
We talked at last, at midnight, for I had
found the clue to his heart in some inscrutable
way beyond my knowledge.  Perhaps he
saw something in me that invited confidence.
Oddly enough, strangers have often enough
opened their hearts to me, when I least expected
it.  There is some deep necessity of confession
in men's hearts, and in speech they compel
sympathy&mdash;or at least they can plead their
own cause.
</p>

<p>
''Tis a black night, sir,' said the old man,
whose real name was Gilby, ''tis a black
enough night.'
</p>

<p>
He was on the look-out, and it was the first
hour after midnight.  I climbed up and stood
beside him close against the windlass, which
looked in the dark like a stiff, distorted corpse
covered with merciful canvas.  The heavens
were low and there was not one star visible.
Wind there was none, and the sea was a dulled
plate of pale dark steel.  What air blew on
the fo'castlehead we made ourselves.  The
cargo derricks on their platforms held watch
with us: they looked diabolical and all alert.
Under the straight stem of the <i>Hindoo</i> the sea
hissed lightly like water escaping from a cock.
The vibration of the engines was muffled
for'ard; but it beat like a steady pulse.
</p>

<p>
'Ay, it's a very dark night,' I answered,
as I stood alongside him in the very eyes
of her.
</p>

<p>
I glanced up at the mast-head light, and
what glow came to me blinded me still more.
But the light was a kind of comfort.  And so
were the side lights.  One could believe with
the Chinese that a vessel might see with
painted eyes on the bow.  Neither of us spoke
a word for full ten minutes.
</p>

<p>
'You've been a seaman, sir?' he asked
presently.
</p>

<p>
'Twenty years ago.'
</p>

<p>
I went back twenty years, and was no more
than a boy.  Now was my 'Twenty Years
After.'  My old companions were dead or lost
in the years.
</p>

<p>
'Twenty years you say, sir?'
</p>

<p>
There was something strange in his voice,
an eagerness, a sharp pain.
</p>

<p>
'Full twenty,' I answered, dreaming.
</p>

<p>
'When I was young it seemed as if a man
would forget anything in twenty years, sir.'
</p>

<p>
There were things one couldn't forget.  I
knew that, and I knew that here was an
unforgetful heart of pain.  My curiosity seemed
most unworthy, and I was ashamed of it.  But
the old man spoke, and I knew he was not old.
</p>

<p>
'It's yesterday, sir,' he said in a low voice,
'and this very night in November&mdash;twenty
years ago!  A dark night enough, and yet
a strange light in it.  Did you ever play
Jack-all-alone at sea, sir? was you ever by yourself
at sea?  That's the terror of the sea, sir.  A
sticky, wet, clammy terror.  For we've mates
in ships, even if we don't speak.  Have you
ever felt the big sea and the sky, sir, spread
out and spread over for you alone?'
</p>

<p>
I had spent one night at sea alone in the
English Channel in the fine but foolhardy game
of single-handed sailing.  He brought it back
to me now, and I sat in a little fifteen-foot
cutter-rigged open boat in a great and gorgeous
calm to the south and east of Dungeness Point.
At sunset the wind failed, and left me at the
will of the tides.  For a long hour the golden
west was a wonder of fine colour, and the sky
overhead a most heavenly pale blue.  The
low coast towards Romney was a faint dark
line, submerged in the sea.  Elms ashore
looked like massed shipping; a church-tower
was dark against the sunset.  Dungeness light
glared over me, and I drifted on the last of the
north-west curve of the tide into its red sector
shining like blood on the lip of the moving
water.  An infinite and most infinitely deep
silence oppressed and purified me.  This was
the purification of the ancient and immortal
tragedy of the sea.  I sat in a red flood and
the day died.  The piety of the great darkness
buried the earth.  Till midnight came I was
alone and was nothing; a mere fleck of foam;
I was all things; I was the world itself.  Then
a great fishing-smack drifted to me.  I spoke
to a dim shadow in the heavy shadow of great
sails that hung motionless.  I lost that voice
again in the drifting of the tide and in a faint
light air.  Then at last the dawn broke, and
the winking lights of land died down and the
day and the land arose, and I was no longer
alone.
</p>

<p>
'I knew it for a night,' I said.  It is the
rarest thing for any seaman to know.  In this
was his disastrous story.  'How did it happen
to you?  Would it hurt you to tell me, or
would it help?'
</p>

<p>
There was no more unworthy curiosity in
me, and that I was purified of it he must have
felt.  For this was a man who could feel and
remember.  God's great gift of forgetfulness is
mostly given to the highest and to the lowest
only.  I drifted for a moment on my own sea
of memory, and when I came back I heard him
speaking.  Those who have been long silent
come some day to an hour of strange and easy
speech.
</p>

<p>
'I and my brothers&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
I heard his voice catch on the word and get
over it with a bitter jar, as a vessel might slide
over a shoal in uncharted waters.  Yet he knew
those waters of Marah well.
</p>

<p>
'We was in a rotten old steamer, sir, them
and me.  Jack was my elder, and a fine big
chap, good as gold, and as brave and strong
as a lion; a real seaman, such as one don't
meet nowadays.  He mostly sailed in windjammers,
but he was one of those that like to
see things, and he had a fancy to potter round
the Mediterranean once in a way.  He'd read
a lot at sea one passage in a Green's ship that
had a fair pile of books in her for the crowd
for'ard, and he'd a fancy to see Italy and
Greece.  He'd talk by the hour of old Romans,
and a strange character that was at Syracuse
some time back; I disremember his name, but
he was for science and arithmetic; and he knew
the name of a score of Roman emperors quite
pat; and he said once when we was at the port
of Athens that a hill plain to be seen was the
home of the gods in the days before Christianity
came to the fore.  He was a first-class man at
whatever he took to, that he was, and might
have been high up if he'd had a chance to
be properly eddicated.  And Billy, my young
brother, was a fine boy of quite another guess
sort.  He cared for nothing but fun, and he
was good-looking, and a rare youngster with
his dooks.  I've seen him down a Dutchman
twice his weight, and do it laughing.  He was
bright as the day, sir, bright as sunlight, and
there we was, the three of us, in this rotten old
tramp, built in the year one of steamships, and
much the shape and size of a biscuit-tin, and
not much to her that was better material.  And
so we mucked about the Mediterranean looking
for cargo, like the sea-tramps we was, and
every time it blew a capful of wind we had to
turn her nose to it and keep bobbing.  For if
there was any kind of a sea on the beam, she'd
roll so cruel that our hearts was in our mouths.
And Billy's joke was always the old sea-joke
that she had rolled right over in the night, and
done it so quick that no one knew it.  But, I
own, she put the fear of God into most of us,
and some of us got that narvous, we couldn't
sit quiet unless there was a flat calm, and her
just joggin' on ahead like an old hay-wagon.
We went down from Barcelona with some sort
of truck to Constant, and there Jack did talk
a lot about emperors, and he was pleased as
Punch to see things, saying that history grew
rank thereabouts; and he would ask the old
skipper about things dead and gone thousands
of years, so that the old man, never liking to
own he wasn't chock-a-block with knowledge,
used to fidget like one o'clock, and get that cross
with dodging 'twas a game to hear him.  And
then we went humping up the Black Sea, and
brought out wheat from Ibrail, and we got stuck
down at Sulina, and lightered her clear and had
a holy time, so that Jack said making history
in the wheat trade was no joke.  And we came
out from Constant for home.  But home we
never got, sir, and to say the truth, I've never
been home since, and never shall go.  Do you
know the Mediterranean, sir?'
</p>

<p>
Did I know it?  Even as he talked I had
been thinking of Crete on our starboard beam
at night, and of Etna right ahead at dawn, and
the white cities of the Straits, of lava-bound
Catania, of old historic Syracuse, of the
sickle-shaped harbour of Messina, of high Taormina,
and the day breaking in the hollows of the grey
Calabrian hills.  Then smoking Stromboli, a
cinder peak of the seas.  And afterwards
singing, roaring Naples and atmospheric Capri
sunk in sweet blue air.  Oh, did I know it?
</p>

<p>
'Ay, I know it.'
</p>

<p>
'We came up with Sicily, and went in by the
Straits to drop some truck or another at Messina,
and then out again to the north, and when
we were near alongside Volcano, it was looking
bad and grey and hard as it does when a
levanter threatens.  The sea got up, and it was
short and steep and hard, sir.  And for a while
we battered among the islands and Volcano
smoking and, I dessay, Stromboli too, but the
smother of the weather was too thick to see it.
And I was on the lookout, as I am now, and
Jack he was relieved at the wheel as I came up
on the fo'c'slehead.  He laughed up at me, and
said, "This top-heavy old hay-wagon will be
doin' a roll directly."  And just as he went
below, the skipper, who was as afraid of her as he
had a right to be, turned her about and put her
nose into the wind.  There she stayed, uneasy
and sawin' with her 'ead like a swell
carriage-'orse.  And they just went ahead with the old
scrap-engines, and stayed so, reckoning to ride
the gale out.  And she rode it right enough
till night, and we three brothers 'ad supper
and passed our jokes.  And poor Billy was as
bright a kid as ever&mdash;oh, I can think of things
'e said now.'
</p>

<p>
He stopped speaking for a moment and
dashed his fist on the rail.
</p>

<p>
'By God, it's twenty years ago, sir,' he said
choking.  'And old Volcano's smoking yet,
like a giant's pipe in the dark, puff and glow,
puff and glow.  And that man-drowning tank
we was in lies a thousand fathoms deep to the
west of Volcano.'
</p>

<p>
He didn't speak for a while, and when he did
his voice was calmer.
</p>

<p>
'Don't think, sir, that I'd ha' complained of
the common fortunes of the sea.  Men are
drowned, they go overboard, silent it may be,
or they drop from aloft howling awful, and in
the smother of a wreck when the sea's a wild
beast, it's the lot of men to go.  I've seen fire
at sea, sir, and death in many shapes, sudden
and slow, killing and fever.  But the way my
brothers died&mdash;why, sir, I held their hands and
couldn't save 'em, held their hands and could
see their faces.  Jack-all-alone, seamen say!
I was Jack-all-alone, while they cried out to me!
</p>

<p>
'You can reckon, sir, that such a craft, such
a rotten, shaky, scrap-heap hooker, such a
thing that oughtn't to have been outside a river,
wasn't over well found.  And those that had
the finding of 'er 'ad to make a bit of stealage.
'Alf the skippers and engineers of such takes
their lives in their 'ands not for the pay, but
for the bit of a make.  And yet I'd not think
it possible for the engineer to 'ave bin in the
oil racket that came out that night.  They was
short of oil in Constant, and got some aboard
from a rotten Levantine Greek with a Harmenian
for partner, and it was bad oil enough,
to be sure.  But the worst was that some o' the
drums was a quarter oil and the rest water.
And I, being on deck after supper, caught on
to what the chief engineer said to our skipper.
He came up running, and went on the bridge.
</p>

<p>
'"Cap'en, most o' that oil was water, and
the oil's that bad the bearin's are overwarm.
Can't I stop 'er?"
</p>

<p>
'"Stop 'er!" says the old man.  I knew
that voice; 'e was that narvous of his old
tank.  "Why, man, if we stop 'er, she'll roll
over!"
</p>

<p>
'The seas was 'eavy, my word, considering
where we was.  She plunged and shook and
creaked like a kicked tin can.
</p>

<p>
'"I'm edgin' of 'er in under Volcano," says
the skipper.  "I want more steam, not less."
</p>

<p>
'"By God, you can't 'ave it," said the
engineer, as desperate as you like.
</p>

<p>
'"Play the 'ose on your blasted bearin's,"
pipes the skipper, with a voice like a bosun's
whistle.
</p>

<p>
'"I'm playin' it," says the other.
</p>

<p>
'"Then you know what to do," squeaks the
old man.
</p>

<p>
'And the engineer comes down tearin' 'is very
beard.  And I was took with a kind of a shiver,
which was curious seeing that mostly sailormen
never gives a damn what 'appens till the worst
opens its mouth for 'em.  I went down into the
fo'c'sle and looked at Jack fast asleep, and Billy
under 'im.  There was only four of us for'ard,
and they two was the starboard watch.  That
was the last time I saw more of 'em than their
'ands.  I went on deck again, never wakin'
'em.  And then I 'eard the engineer on deck
again.
</p>

<p>
'"I'll 'ave to stop my engines," he cried,
"or if I don't they'll stop theirselves.  There's
three bearin's sizzling, and the white metal's
running, and the engine-room's full o' steam
from the 'ose playin' on 'em."
</p>

<p>
'"You can't stop," said the skipper.  And
the wind blew like a blast out of a pipe; it
squealed, and she stopped a'most dead.
</p>

<p>
'"Give us a quarter of an hour," says the
old man, and he puts the second mate alongside
of him.  "Call the 'ands, and rig up a
sea-anchor."
</p>

<p>
'And that was too late, for there was a crack
below, and a man screamed, and the engineer
bolted for his hole.  But the engines stopped
right there, and the nose of 'er paid off, and she
lay in the trough of the sea, and rolled once,
and rolled twice.  And she went over to
windward till you'd 'ear everything crack, and then
she rolled to loo'ard.  Would she ever stop!
I see the old man slide away down the bridge,
squealin', and the second mate pitched off his
feet, and I gave a yell and climbed up on the
weather rail, and old Volcano glared red over
us to the nor'ard.  And she was crank, and was
never meant for the sea, and she 'ad 'eavy
useless spars and derricks that overweighted 'er,
and her grain was in bulk, and not too much
of it.  And the wind got hold of her, and she
never stopped.  I 'eard the old man yell again,
and the sea rose up against him, and the
sleeping mate was screamin' in his berth with
a jammed door.  And then I was Jack-all-alone,
scramblin' with bleedin' fingers up a
rotten wet iron slope, and I stopped when I 'ad
'old of 'er very keel.  And then I 'eard an
awful rip and a tearing, and a boom under my
feet, and I reckoned the 'ole of 'er engines
dropped through her deck, and may be the
boilers exploded, for she gave a 'eave on the sea
that made me sick, and I 'ung on with my
nails, and I found myself cryin' out "Billy"
and "Jack," and I was mad that hour.  Ay, I
was mad, and I beat upon the black and weedy
iron of the plates underneath me.  I was warm
to think I was saved, and I was a coward, and
I shook and trembled and nigh slipped off as
the old scow wallowed.  'Twas most 'orrible
to be 'earin' warm and livin' men speakin'
one moment, to be among 'em, and them
talkin', and to see the warm light, and to 'ear
the thump, thump, of the engines, and the
crackin' and creakin' of the old <i>Red Star</i>, and
then to be all alone, Jack-all-alone, sailing
'and in 'and with death, 'ove up not on an 'alf
tide rock as the thing beneath me looked, but
a rotten old steamer turned turtle, and like to
slip away from me any moment.  And as I
'owled to myself, and saw the white water run
up and lip at me like open-mouthed sharks, I
saw the red light of Volcano away high up, and
the light was like the wink of a light'ouse
blinded in a fog.  And the sight of the land,
or where the land was, maddened me, and I
cried like a child with weakness.  'Twas most
'orrible, sir, and weakness took me so, that I
slipped and nigh lost 'old of the keel.  But
I climbed up again desperate, and findin' a
bolt worked out, I 'itched my belt to it and
'ung on.
</p>

<p>
'And then I 'eard a sound that made my 'eart
stop beatin'.  'Twas as if some one was usin'
an 'ammer on iron, and I knew that there was
some one alive inside of the <i>Red Star</i>, cooped up
under 'er keel and shut into a tomb.  And I
cried, "You can't get out, you can't get out,
mates!" so that my voice made me afraid.  For
'twas a scream and like no voice I'd ever 'eard.
But I scrambled along the keel and came to
where the 'ammerin' was, and then I knew
that they was Jack or Billy, or maybe both, and
I beat with my fists on the plates, and I bled,
but didn't know it, and I prayed all the plates
was as rotten as we believed.  But they wasn't
that bad, and they was iron and iron bolted,
and I'd nought but a knife, and what they was
workin' with inside I couldn't tell.  And they
was in foul 'eavy air, and in the blackest dark.
I prayed and I cursed, and I beat again, and
some one 'eard, for they knocked three times
regular and three times again, and to answer I
beat with the 'eft of my knife.  And then they
worked awful, and there was bitter times when
they rested, and in all the cold of the Levanter
and the wetness of the flyin' spray I sweated like
a bull, and then I was as cold as ice.  And in
an 'our or more, there was some sign that what
they did was tellin' on the plate they worked
on.  For all of a sudden I 'eard a strange
sound like the 'issing of steam blowin' off.
'Twas the compressed air inside that kept the
wreck afloat comin' sharp out of a bit of a
crack.  And I knew that every second she'd
sink more and more, and I seemed to see that
unless the plate came off quick, they only die
the quicker for tryin' to escape.  And I called
to 'em, but they 'eard nothin', only knowin'
that a man was above 'em.  And I got my
knife under the plate and the blade broke.  I
worked sobbin', and all the time I was talkin'.
'Twas madness, plain and to be 'eard, and then
I felt a smash into the iron, and the end of a
splice bar came through it, and the air screamed
up under me, and I knocked again three times,
and they knocked three times, and I screamed
out, "Billy!  Jack!" and the poor chaps 'eard
me.  Jack's voice came to me like a voice out
o' the grave, thin and eager, and all of a scream&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'"Tom&mdash;Tom!"
</p>

<p>
'That was me!  Oh, the sea at my cold feet,
and the sound of the wind and the red pulsin' of
Volcano, and the round 'ump of the <i>Red Star</i>
'ove out o' the sea like the bulk of a dead whale,
and under me my brothers.  There's brothers
don't love each other!
</p>

<p>
'I screamed&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'"Work&mdash;work!"
</p>

<p>
'And the sea crawled up to me, or so it
seemed, and the thick air spurted up at me
that was their life.  And they broke out a bit
more, and 'twas an 'ole a man's 'and could
come through.  And they stopped, so that I
cried again to 'em.  I 'eard Jack plain.
</p>

<p>
'"I'm about done, lad!"
</p>

<p>
'"Where's Billy?"
</p>

<p>
'I beat on cold and jagged iron.
</p>

<p>
'"He's here," said Jack, "but the air's too
bad for him."
</p>

<p>
'I bade him give me the bar, and I worked
outside like a mad one.  But they'd struck the
only rotten spot, and I couldn't get edge or
claws of the bar under the plate.  "The water's
risin'," said Jack.  He put 'is poor 'and out, and
I took it.  Sir, I didn't think there was a God
then!  And the sea lipped at me, and the
<i>Red Star</i> wallowed, and there was red on the
edge of the lipping waves from a big glare of Volcano.
</p>

<p>
'"I've no purchase to get an 'old out 'ere," I
said.  And still the 'ot thick air came up, foul
as could be.  And Jack took the bar and
dropped it.  There's a strange weakness
comes over one breathin' such air.  I 'eard
'is voice again&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'"The bar's deep in water, I can't feel it."
</p>

<p>
'Then 'e lifted Billy, and Billy put 'is 'and out.
</p>

<p>
"She's sinkin', Tom," said Billy.  'E spoke
like a chap in a dream, and the water was to
my feet as I sat across the keel.  And I felt
the boy's strength give, and I 'eld 'is 'and
tight.  But neither him nor Jack spoke again,
and the boy struggled dreadful.  And presently
'er bows was deeper than 'er stern, and I felt
water inside of 'er, and I knew they was dead.
And I 'ad an 'old of the boy's 'and, and me
cryin' and shriekin' out I don't know what.
Then 'e slipped away, and I was all awash,
and I floated off and took 'old of a big bit of
gratin', and the old <i>Red Star</i> 'eaved up 'er
stern a bit and then went down.  And I lay
till dawn on the gratin', no sensible man,
but crazy, and old Volcano winked at me
like a red flare in a fog.  And I dreamed
of sailin' in a ship with Jack captain as 'e
meant to be some day, being given to larnin',
and at daybreak a fishin' craft took me into
Messina.'
</p>

<p>
I walked the deck of the fo'c'slehead with
him for many long silent minutes.  Then some
one struck two bells aft, and he struck it on the
big bell at the break of the fo'c'slehead.  Then
he walked for'ard alone.  He called to me after
a minute.
</p>

<p>
'Do you see a light on the port bow, sir?'
he asked me.
</p>

<p>
'I see it, Gilby.'
</p>

<p>
'That's Volcano, sir.'
</p>

<p>
He reported it to the officer on the bridge.

<h3>
THE MUTINOUS CONDUCT OF MRS. RYDER
</h3>

<p>
Although Watchett of the <i>Battle-Axe</i>, and
Ryder of the <i>Star of the South</i>, were cousins,
there was no great love lost between them, and
all unprejudiced observers declared that this
lack of mutual admiration was in no way due to
Captain Ryder.  That they remained friends at
all was owing largely to his infinite good-nature
and to the further fact that Mrs. Ryder pitied
Mrs. Watchett.
</p>

<p>
'I wonder she goes to sea with him at all,'
she said.  'If you were one-quarter as horrid
as your cousin, Will, I should never go to sea
till you came ashore.'
</p>

<p>
But she always went to sea with Will Ryder.
It was their great delight to be together, and
there were few men, married or single, who did
not take a certain pleasure in seeing how fond
they were of each other.  He was a typical
seaman of the best kind; he had a fine voice
for singing, and for hailing the fore-topsail
yard; his eyes were as blue as forget-me-nots,
and his skin was as clear as the air on the
Cordilleras, which peeped at them over the tops of
the barren hills which surround the Bay of
Valparaiso.  And Mrs. Ryder was just the kind of
wife for a man who was somewhat inclined to
take things easily.  If she was as pretty as a
peach, she had, like the peach, something inside
which was not altogether soft.  Her brown eyes
could turn black; she had resolution and courage.
</p>

<p>
'You shall not put up with it,' was a favourite
expression on her tongue.  And there were times,
to use his own expression, when she made sail
when he would have shortened it.  In that sense
she was certainly capable of 'carrying on.'
</p>

<p>
Both vessels were barques of about 1100 tons
register, and if the <i>Star of the South</i> had about
twenty tons to the good in size she was rather
harder to work.  It is the nature of ships to
develop in certain ways, and though both of
these barques were sister ships, it is always
certain that sister ships are never quite alike.
But as they belonged to the same port of
London, and were owned by two branches
of the same family, all of whose money was
divided up in 64ths, according to the common
rule with ships, they were rivals and rival
beauties.  But, unlike the more respectable
ladies who owned them, both the vessels were
fast, and it was a sore point of honour with
Ryder and Watchett to prove their own the
faster.
</p>

<p>
'If she only worked it a little easier I could
lick his head off,' said Ryder sadly.
</p>

<p>
But there was the rub.  The <i>Star of the
South</i> needed more 'beef' in her than the
<i>Battle-Axe</i>.  She wasn't so quick in stays.  By
the time Ryder yelled, 'Let go and haul,' the
<i>Battle-Axe</i> was gathering headway on a fresh
tack.
</p>

<p>
'And instead of having two more hands than
we are allowed, we are two short,' said his wife
bitterly.  'If I were you, Will, I'd take these
Greeks.'
</p>

<p>
'Not by an entire jugful,' replied Captain
Ryder.  'I remember the <i>Lennie</i> and the
<i>Caswell</i>, my dear.  I never knew Valparaiso
so bare of men.'
</p>

<p>
'And we're sailing to-morrow,' said Connie
Ryder angrily, 'and you've betted him a
hundred pounds we shall dock before him.
It's too bad.  I wonder whether he'd give us
another day?'
</p>

<p>
But Ryder shook his head.
</p>

<p>
'And you've known him for years!  He's
spending that money in his mind.'
</p>

<p>
'But not on his wife, Will,' said Mrs. Ryder.
'If we win I'm to have it.'
</p>

<p>
'I'd give him twenty to let me off,' said Ryder.
</p>

<p>
But Connie Ryder went on board the <i>Battle-Axe</i>
to see if she could not induce her husband's
cousin to forgo the advantage he had already
gained before sailing.  She found him dark
and grim, and as hard as adamant.
</p>

<p>
'A bet's a bet, and business is business,'
said Watchett.  'We app'inted to-morrow, and
bar lying out a gale from the north with two
anchors down, and cables out to the bitter end,
I'll sail.'
</p>

<p>
His wife, who was as meek as milk, suggested
humbly that it would be more interesting if he
waited.
</p>

<p>
'I ain't in this for interest.  I'm in it for
capital,' said Watchett, grinning gloomily.
'The more like a dead certainty it looks the
better I shall be pleased.'
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Ryder darkened.
</p>

<p>
'I don't think you're a sportsman,' said she
rather curtly.
</p>

<p>
'I ain't,' retorted Watchett, 'I'm a seaman,
and him that'd go to sea for sport would go to
hell for pastime.  You can tell Bill I'll give
him ten per cent. discount for cash now.'
</p>

<p>
As Mrs. Ryder knew that he never called her
husband 'Bill' unless he desired to be more or
less offensive, she showed unmistakable signs
of temper.
</p>

<p>
'If I ever get half a chance to make you sorry,
I will,' she said.
</p>

<p>
'Let it go at that,' said Watchett sulkily.  'I
got on all right with Bill before you took to
going to sea with him.'
</p>

<p>
'He was too soft with you,' said Bill's wife.
</p>

<p>
'And a deal softer with you than I'd be,' said
Watchett.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, please, please don't,' cried Mary
Watchett in great distress.
</p>

<p>
'I thought you were a gentleman,' said
Connie Ryder.
</p>

<p>
'Not you,' replied Watchett, 'you never, and
you know it.  I'm not one, and never hankered
to be.  I'm rough and tough, and a seaman of
the old school.  I'm no sea dandy.  I'm Jack
Watchett, as plain as you like.'
</p>

<p>
'You're much plainer than I like,' retorted
his cousin's wife; 'very much plainer.'
</p>

<p>
And though she kissed Mary Watchett, she
wondered greatly how any woman could kiss
Mary Watchett's husband.
</p>

<p>
'If I ever get a chance,' she said.  'But
there, how can I?'
</p>

<p>
She wept a little out of pure anger as she
returned to the <i>Star of the South</i>.  When she
got on board she found the mate and second
mate standing by the gangway.
</p>

<p>
'Is there no chance of those men, Mr. Semple?'
</p>

<p>
'No more than if it was the year '49, and this
was San Francisco,' said the mate, who was a
hoary-headed old sea-dog, a great deal more
like the old school than 'plain Jack Watchett.'
</p>

<p>
'Why doesna' the captain take the Greeks,
ma'am?' asked M'Gill, the second mate, who
had been almost long enough out of Scotland
to forget his own language.
</p>

<p>
'Because he doesn't like any but Englishmen,'
said Connie Ryder.
</p>

<p>
'And Scotch, of course,' she added, as she
saw M'Gill's jaw fall a little.  'I've been
trying to get Captain Watchett to give us
another day.'
</p>

<p>
'All our ship and cargo to a paper bag of
beans, he didn't,' said Semple.
</p>

<p>
'I&mdash;I hate him,' cried Connie Ryder, as she
entered the cabin.
</p>

<p>
'She's as keen as mustard, as red pepper,'
said Semple.  'If she'd been a man she'd
have made a seaman.'
</p>

<p>
'I've never sailed wi' a skeeper's wife before,'
said M'Gill, who had shipped in the <i>Star of the
South</i> a week before, in place of the second
mate, who had been given his discharge for
drunkenness; 'is she at all interferin', Mr. Semple?'
</p>

<p>
Old Semple nodded.
</p>

<p>
'She interferes some, and it would be an
obstinate cook that disputed with her.  She
made a revolution in the galley, my word,
when she first came on board.  Some would
say she cockered the crew over much, but I was
long enough in the fo'c'sle not to forget that
even a hog of a man don't do best on hog-wash,'
which was a marvellous concession on
the part of any of the afterguard of any ship,
seeing how the notion persists among owners,
and even among officers, that the worse men
are treated the better they work.
</p>

<p>
'She seems a comfortable ship,' owned M'Gill.
</p>

<p>
And so every one on board of her allowed.
</p>

<p>
'Though she is a bit of a heart-breaker
to handle,' said the men for'ard.  'But for
that she be a daisy.  And to think that the
bally <i>Battle-Axe</i> goes about like a racing
yacht.'
</p>

<p>
It made them sore to think of it.  But it also
made the men on board their rival sore to think
how comfortable the <i>Star of the South</i> was in
all other respects.
</p>

<p>
'The "old man" 'ere makes up for any ease
wiv w'ich we ploughs the briny seas,' declared
Bill Gribbs, who was a Cockney of the purest
water, with a turn for reciting poetry and
playing the concertina.  'For two pins I'd desert.
I'm too merry for old Watchett.  I'll make a
new chanty for 'im speshul, exteree speshul,
same as I did for the cook comin' out.'
</p>

<p>
'And it took the "doctor" the best part of a
month to get over it and do the 'ash 'alf proper
agin,' said the rest of the crowd sadly.  'Poetry
and music will be your undoin', Gribbs.  It
don't pay us for'ard to guy them as is aft.'
</p>

<p>
'And didn't the "old man" stop my playin'
my concertina on Sundays?' asked Gribbs.
'And all because I don't know no 'ymn tunes.
As they says out 'ere, it tires me to think of
it.  I'll be gettin' even wiv 'im some day.  I'll
commit susancide and 'aunt 'im.  'Owsever,
wot's the odds, for "it's 'ome, deary, 'ome;
it's 'ome I wish to be," and we're sailin' in
the mawnin'!'
</p>

<p>
Owing to the fact that the <i>Battle-Axe's</i> crowd
was sulky, the <i>Star of the South</i> got her anchor
out of the ground and stood to the north-west
to round Point Angelos a good ten minutes
before Watchett's vessel was under way.
</p>

<p>
'That's good,' said Connie Ryder.  'I know
they're a sulky lot by now in the <i>Battle-Axe</i>.
And our men work like dears.'
</p>

<p>
It was with difficulty she kept from tailing
on to the braces as they jammed the <i>Star</i> close
up to weather the Point.  For the wind was
drawing down the coast from the nor'ard, and
Valparaiso harbour faces due north.  She was
glad when they rounded the Point and squared
away, for if there was any real difference in
the sailing qualities of the rival barques, the
<i>Star</i> was best with the wind free and the <i>Battle-Axe</i>
when she was on a bowline.
</p>

<p>
'And with any real luck,' said Mrs. Ryder,
'we may have a good, fair wind all the way
till we cross the Line.'
</p>

<p>
It was so far ahead to consider the
North-East Trades, which meant such mighty long
stretches on a wind that she declined to think
of them.
</p>

<p>
'We're doing very well, Will,' she said to
her husband when the starboard watch went
below, and the routine of the passage home commenced.
</p>

<p>
'It's early days,' replied Will Ryder.  'I
fancy the <i>Battle-Axe</i> is in her best trim for
a wind astern.'
</p>

<p>
But Mrs. Ryder didn't believe it.
</p>

<p>
'And if she is, she mayn't be so good when
it comes to beating.'
</p>

<p>
She knew what she was talking about, and
spoke good sense.
</p>

<p>
'It's going to be luck,' said Ryder.  'If
either of us get a good slant that the other
misses, the last will be out of it.  But I wish
I'd had those other two hands.  The <i>Star</i>
wants beef on the braces.  Mr. Semple, as
soon as possible see all the parrals greased
and the blocks running as free as you can make 'em.'
</p>

<p>
And Semple did his best, as the crew did.
But Mrs. Ryder had her doubts as to whether
her husband was doing his.  For once he
seemed to think failure was a foregone conclusion.
</p>

<p>
'I think it must be his liver,' said Mrs. Ryder.
'I'll see to that at once.'
</p>

<p>
But instead of looking up the medicine-chest
she came across the <i>Pacific Directory</i>.
</p>

<p>
'I never thought of that,' she said.  'He's
never done it: now he shall.'
</p>

<p>
She took the big book down and read one
part of it eagerly.
</p>

<p>
'I don't see why not,' she decided; and she
went to her husband with the request that he
should run through Magellan's Straits when he
came to it.
</p>

<p>
'Not for dollars,' said Will Ryder.  'When
I'm skipper of a Pacific Navigation boat I'll
take you through, but not till then.'
</p>

<p>
'But look at all you cut off,' urged his wife,
'if you get through.'
</p>

<p>
'And how you are cut off if you don't,'
retorted Ryder.  'When I was an apprentice I
went through in fine weather for the Straits,
and I'd rather drive a 'bus down Fleet Street
in a fog than try it.'
</p>

<p>
She said he had very little enterprise, and
pouted.
</p>

<p>
'Suppose the <i>Battle-Axe</i> does it?'
</p>

<p>
Ryder declined to suppose it.
</p>

<p>
'John wouldn't try it if you guarantee the
weather.  I know him.'
</p>

<p>
'You never take my advice,' said his wife.
</p>

<p>
'I love you too much,' replied Will Ryder.
He put his arm about her, but she was cross,
and pushed him away.
</p>

<p>
'This is mutiny,' said the captain, smiling.
</p>

<p>
'Well, I feel mutinous,' retorted Connie.  'I
wanted you to steal two of your cousin's men and
you wouldn't.  I'm sure they would have come
for what the <i>Battle-Axe</i> owed them.  And you
wouldn't.  And now I want to go through the
Straits and you won't.  The very, very next
time that I want to do anything I shall do it
without asking you.  Why did you bet a
hundred pounds if you weren't prepared to try
to win it?'
</p>

<p>
'We'll win yet,' said the skipper, cheerfully.
'We've only just started.'
</p>

<p>
The two vessels kept company right down to
the Horn, and there, between Ildefonso Island
and the Diego Ramirez Islands, the <i>Star of
the South</i> lost sight of her sister and rival
in a dark sou'westerly gale.  With the wind
astern when they squared away with Cape
Horn frowning to the nor'west, the <i>Star</i> was
a shooting star, as they said for'ard.
</p>

<p>
'If we could on'y carry a gale like this right
to the Line we'd 'ave a pull over the
<i>Battle-Axe</i>, ma'am,' said Silas Bagge, an old
fo'c'sle-man, who was Mrs. Ryder's favourite among
all the crew.  He was a magnificent old chap,
with a long white beard, which he wore tucked
inside a guernsey, except in fine weather.
</p>

<p>
'But we can't; there'll be the Trades,' said
the captain's wife dolorously.
</p>

<p>
'I've picked up the sou'east Trade blowin'
a gale, ma'am, before now,' said Bagge; 'years
ago, in '74 or thereabouts, I was in the
<i>Secunderabad</i>, and we crossed the Line bound south,
doing eleven close-'auled, and we carried 'em to
27° south latitude.  There's times when it is
difficult to say where the Trades begin south,
too.  Mebbe we'll be chased by such a gale
as this nigh up to 30° south.'
</p>

<p>
'It's hoping too much,' said Mrs. Ryder.
</p>

<p>
'Hope till ye bust, ma'am,' said Silas Bagge.
'Nothin''s lost till it's won.  If we can only
get out of the doldrums without breakin' our
hearts working the ship, there's no knowing
what'll 'appen.  'Twas a pity we didn't get
them other two 'ands, though.'
</p>

<p>
And there she agreed with him.
</p>

<p>
'Me and Bob Condy could 'ave got Gribbs
and Tidewell out of the <i>Battle-Axe</i> as easy
as eat,' said Silas regretfully.  ''Twas a lost
hopportunity, and there you are!'
</p>

<p>
The honourable conduct of his skipper in
vetoing this little game seemed no more than
foolishness to Bagge.
</p>

<p>
'When we comes to the Hequator, and it's
"square away" and "brace up" every five
minutes till one's 'ands are raw, 'twill be a
grief to every mother's son aboard,' said Bagge,
as he touched his cap and went for'ard.
</p>

<p>
But now the <i>Star of the South</i> went booming
on the outside of the Falklands with a gale
that drew into the sou'-sou'-west and howled
after her.  She scooped up the seas at times
and dipped her nose into them, and threw them
apart and wallowed.  The men were happy, for
the fo'c'sle didn't leak, and the galley-fire was
kept going every night to dry their clothes.
At midnight every man got a mug of cocoa,
and those that rose up called Mrs. Ryder
blessed, and those that lay down agreed with
them.  The <i>Star</i> was a happy ship.  There
was no rule against playing the concertina on
a Sunday in her fo'c'sle, and the men were not
reduced to playing 'blind swaps' with their
oldest rags for amusement as they were in the
<i>Battle-Axe</i>.  And yet every man in the <i>Star</i>
knew his time for growling was coming on
with every pitch and scend of the sea.
</p>

<p>
''Oly sailor, buy a knife and 'ave a shackle
to it,' said Bob Condy, who was the
lightest-hearted of a happy crowd, 'but when we're
p'intin' all round the compass in the doldrums,
won't my pore 'ands suffer!  I've a notion
we'll go through the 'orse latitoods flyin'.
We're carryin' a good gale, and she'll draw
into the eastward by and by.'
</p>

<p>
And there he was right, for they picked up
the Trades in nearly 30° south, with only a few
days of a light and variable breeze, and the
Trades were good.
</p>

<p>
'But where's the <i>Battle-Axe</i>?' asked
Mrs. Ryder.  She kept a bright look-out for her,
and deeply regretted that her petticoats
prevented her going aloft to search the horizon
for John Watchett.  She rubbed her hands
in hope.
</p>

<p>
'I do believe, Will, that we must be ahead
of him,' she declared after the South-East Trade
had been steady on the <i>Star's</i> starboard beam
for a week.
</p>

<p>
'Not much ahead,' replied Will.
</p>

<p>
And just then Bob Condy, who was aloft
on the fore-t'gallant yard cutting off old
seizings and putting on new ones, hailed the
deck.
</p>

<p>
'There's a sail on the port beam, sir.'
</p>

<p>
'Take a glass aloft and have a look at her,
Mr. M'Gill,' said the skipper.  'No, never mind;
I'll go myself, as you've never seen the
<i>Battle-Axe</i> at sea.  I know the cut of her jib and no
mistake.'
</p>

<p>
So Will Ryder went up on the main top-gallant
yard, and with his leg astride of the
yard took a squint to loo'ard.  He shut up
the glass so quick that his wife knew at once
that the distant sail was the <i>Battle-Axe</i>.  As
he came down slowly he nodded to her.
</p>

<p>
'It is?'
</p>

<p>
'Rather,' said Ryder.  'I'm sorry we've no
stunsails.  We're carrying all we've got and
all we can.'
</p>

<p>
'And to think he's as good as we were on
our own point of sailing,' said his wife with
the most visible vexation.  'Can't you do
anything to make her go faster, Will?'
</p>

<p>
And when Will said he couldn't, unless he
got out and pushed, Mrs. Ryder sat on a
hen-coop and very nearly cried.  For if the
<i>Battle-Axe</i> had done so well up to this she would do
better in the dead regions of the Line, and the
<i>Star</i> would do much worse.  There the want of
a few more hands would tell.  The <i>Star</i> was
no good at catching 'cat's-paws' short-handed.
She worked like an unoiled gate.
</p>

<p>
'If I'd only done what Silas Bagge wanted,'
she said, 'we'd have been all right.  To think
that the want of a couple of hands should make
all the difference!'
</p>

<p>
It was cruelly hard, but when vessels are
under-manned at any time, less than their
complement means 'pull devil pull baker,' with the
devil best at the tug of war.
</p>

<p>
For days there was nothing to choose between
the vessels, save that the unusual strength of
the Trades gave the <i>Star</i> a trifling advantage.
Every night Watchett took in his royals.  This
Ryder declined to do, though he often expected
them to take themselves in.
</p>

<p>
'What did I say, ma'am,' said old Bagge.
'I told you it <i>could</i> blow quite 'eavy in its way
in the South-East Trades.'
</p>

<p>
And thus it happened that what the <i>Star</i>
lost by day she pulled up by night.  And
presently the <i>Battle-Axe</i> edged up closer, and
at last was within hailing distance.  Watchett
stood on his poop with a speaking-trumpet, and
roared in sombre triumph.
</p>

<p>
'I'm as good as you this trip on your best
p'int, Ryder!'
</p>

<p>
'Tell him to go to&mdash;to&mdash;thunder,' said
Mrs. Ryder angrily.  Nevertheless, she waved her
handkerchief to her enemy's wife, who was
standing by 'plain Jack Watchett.'
</p>

<p>
'You've done mighty well,' said Ryder in
his turn, 'but it isn't over yet.'
</p>

<p>
Jack Watchett intimated that he thought it
was.  He offered to double the bet.  He also
undertook to sail round the <i>Star of the South</i> in
a light wind.  He offered to tow her, and made
himself so disagreeable that Mrs. Ryder, who
knew what became a lady, went below to prevent
herself snatching the speaking-trumpet from
her husband and saying things for which she
would be sorry afterwards.  But Ryder, though
he was by no means a saint, kept his temper,
and only replied with chaff, which was much
more offensive to Watchett than bad language.
</p>

<p>
'And don't be <i>too</i> sure,' he added.  'I may
do you yet.'
</p>

<p>
'Not you,' said Watchett, 'I'm cocksure.'
</p>

<p>
They sailed in company for a week, and
gradually as the Trade lessened in driving
power the <i>Battle-Axe</i> drew ahead inch by
inch.  And as she did Mrs. Ryder's appetite
failed; she looked thin and ill.
</p>

<p>
'Don't feel it so much, chickabiddy,' said
her husband.
</p>

<p>
'I can't help it,' sobbed Connie.  'I hate
your cousin.  Oh Will, if you'd only let me
entice those two men from him.  Bagge was
sure that Gribbs and Tidewell would have
come.'
</p>

<p>
'It wouldn't have been fair,' said Ryder.
</p>

<p>
'I&mdash;I w&mdash;wanted to win,' replied Connie,
'and it'll be calm directly, and you know what
that means.'
</p>

<p>
It was calm directly, and very soon every
one knew what it meant.  For it was a real
fat streak of a calm that both vessels ran into.
And as luck would have it, the <i>Battle-Axe</i>,
which was by now almost hull down to the
nor'ard, got into it first.  The <i>Star of the South</i>
carried the wind with her till she was within
a mile of her rival.  For a whole day they
pointed their jibbooms alternately at Africa
and South America, to the North Pole and
the South.  What little breeze there was after
that day took them further still into an absolute
area of no wind at all.
</p>

<p>
'This is the flattest calm I ever saw,' said
Ryder.  'In such a calm as this he has no
advantage.'
</p>

<p>
They boxed the compass for the best part of
a week, and lay and cooked in a sun that made
the deck seams bubble.  At night the air was
as hot as it had been by day.  The men lay
on deck, on the deck-house, on the fo'c'sle-head.
</p>

<p>
'This is a bally scorcher,' said the crews of
both ships.  'Let's whistle!'
</p>

<p>
They whistled feebly, but the god of the
winds had gone a journey, or was as fast asleep
as Dagon.  And day by day the two vessels
drifted together.  At last they had to lower
the boats and tow them apart.  Watchett was
very sick with the whole meteorology of the
universe, and being a whole-souled man
incapable of more than one animosity at a time,
he found no time to spare from damning a
heaven of brass to damn Ryder.  At the end
of the week he even hailed the <i>Star</i> and offered
to come on board and bring his wife.
</p>

<p>
'I don't want him,' said Connie Ryder.  'I
won't have him.'
</p>

<p>
And as she said this she jumped as if a pin
had been stuck into her.
</p>

<p>
'What's the matter?' asked her husband.
</p>

<p>
'Nothing,' said Connie.  'But let him come!'
</p>

<p>
She went for'ard to interview the cook, so she
said.  But she really went to interview Silas
Bagge.  When she came back she found
Watchett and his wife on board.  If she was
a little stiff with Watchett he never noticed it.
As a matter of fact the whims and fads and
tempers of a woman were of no more account
than the growling of the men for'ard.  He was
too much engaged in cursing the weather to pay
her any attention.
</p>

<p>
'This licks me,' he said, 'in a week we
ain't moved: we're stuck.  'Ow long will it
last, Bill?'
</p>

<p>
'It looks as if it might last for ever,' replied
Ryder.  'We've struck a bad streak.'
</p>

<p>
The women had tea and the men drank
whisky and water.  Although Watchett didn't
know it, two of his hands left the boat and were
given something to eat in the galley by
Mrs. Ryder's orders.  It was Bagge who conveyed
the invitation with the connivance of the mate,
for whom the word of the captain's wife was law.
</p>

<p>
''Ave some marmalade and butter,' said
Bagge.  'Does they feed you good in the
<i>Battle-Axe</i>, Gribbs?'
</p>

<p>
'Hog-wash,' said Gribbs with his mouth full.
'Ain't it, Tidewell?'
</p>

<p>
Tidewell, who was a youngster of a good
middle-class family, who had gone to sea as an
apprentice and run from his ship, agreed with
many bitter words.
</p>

<p>
'As I told you, we lives like fightin'-cocks
'ere,' said Bagge.  'When you're full to the
back teeth, we'll 'ave your mates up.  We
likes to feed the pore and 'ungry, don't we, doctor?'
</p>

<p>
The cook, to whom Bagge had confided
something, said he did his best, his humble
best.
</p>

<p>
'The <i>Star</i>'s an 'appy ship,' he added.  'We
know what your ship is.'
</p>

<p>
The other two men came up in their turn and
were filled with tea and biscuit and butter and
marmalade till they smiled.
</p>

<p>
'This is like home,' said Wat Crampe, who
was from Newcastle.
</p>

<p>
'It wass petter, much petter,' said Evan
Evans; 'and ass for the captain's wife, she iss
a lady, whateffer.'
</p>

<p>
That evening Ryder and his wife returned
the call, and were rowed to the <i>Battle-Axe</i> by
Bagge, Bob Condy, and two more of the men.
Bagge and Condy went into the fo'c'sle.  They
lost no time in blaspheming the <i>Battle-Axe</i>,
and in lauding their own ship.
</p>

<p>
'This 'ere's a stinkin' 'ooker, mates,' said
Silas Bagge; 'why, our fo'c'sle is a lady's
droring-room compared with it.  And as for the
grub, ask them as came on board us this
afternoon.  What d 'ye say, Gribbs?'
</p>

<p>
'Toppin',' said Gribbs; 'it's spiled my
happetite 'ere.'
</p>

<p>
'It wass good,' said the Welshman, 'it wass
good, whateffer.'
</p>

<p>
Bagge took Billy Gribbs aside on the deck
and had a talk with him.
</p>

<p>
'Oh Lord!' said Gribbs, 'eh, what?'
</p>

<p>
'Straight talk,' replied Silas, '<i>she</i> said so.'
</p>

<p>
'Do you mean it?'
</p>

<p>
'Do I mean it?' returned Silas with unutterable
scorn.  'In course I mean it.  It will
sarve them right as it sarves right.'
</p>

<p>
Gribbs held on to the rail and laughed till he
ached.
</p>

<p>
'It's the rummest notion I ever 'eard tell on.'
</p>

<p>
'Not so rummy!'
</p>

<p>
'Wot!' cried Gribbs, 'not so rummy?  Well,
it ain't so rummy, I'm jiggered.  I'll think of it.'
</p>

<p>
'Do it, and tell your mate Tidewell.'
</p>

<p>
'If I tell Ned, 'e'll do it for sure.  'E's the
biggest joker 'ere!'
</p>

<p>
'Then tell him,' said Silas.
</p>

<p>
That evening Ned Tidewell and Billy Gribbs
acted in a very strange way on board the
<i>Battle-Axe</i>.  Without any obvious reason they kept
on bursting into violent fits of laughter.
</p>

<p>
'The poor blokes is gone dotty from the 'eat,'
said the pitying crowd.  'We've 'eard of such
before.'
</p>

<p>
'Why shouldn't I laugh?' asked Gribbs.  'I'm
laughin' because I'm a pore silly sailorman,
and my life ain't worth livin'.  If I'd died
early I'd ha' bin saved a pile o' trouble.  I
was thinkin' of my father's green fields as I
looked over the side this afternoon.'
</p>

<p>
'Was you, really?' asked the oldest man on
board, 'then you take my advice quick and go
and ask the skipper for a real good workin' pill
of the largest size.'
</p>

<p>
'Wot for?' asked Gribbs.
</p>

<p>
'Because you hobvus got a calentoor,' said
the old fo'c'sleman.  'And chaps as gets a
calentoor jumps overboard.  Oh, but that's
well known at sea by them as knows anythin'.'
</p>

<p>
But Gribbs laughed.
</p>

<p>
'The worst is as it's catchin',' said his adviser
anxiously, 'it's fatally catchin'.  'I've 'eard of
crews doin' it one hafter the hother till there
warn't no one left.  In 'eat it was and in calm.'
</p>

<p>
'Gammon,' said Gribbs.  But he was observed to sigh.
</p>

<p>
'Are you 'ot in your 'ead?' asked the anxious
and ancient one.
</p>

<p>
'I feels a little 'ot and rummy,' said Gribbs;
'but what I chiefly feels is a desire to eat grass.'
</p>

<p>
The old man groaned.
</p>

<p>
'Then it's got you.  Mates, we ought to tie
Gribbs up, or lock him in the sail-locker, or 'is
clothes will be auctioned off before long.'
</p>

<p>
But Gribbs kicked at that, and just then eight
bells struck.
</p>

<p>
'I'm turnin' in,' said Gribbs, 'and I'm all right.'
</p>

<p>
But at six bells in the first watch he was
missing, as was discovered by old Brooks, the
authority on calentures.  He waked up Ned
Tidewell, who was extraordinarily fast asleep.
</p>

<p>
'Where's Gribbs?'
</p>

<p>
'Not in my bunk,' returned Ned, who with
Gribbs was one of the few who still dossed in
the fo'c'sle.
</p>

<p>
'Then 'e's gone overboard for sartin,' said
Brooks in great alarm; 'there was the look
of it in 'is eye, and in yours, too, youngster.
These long calms is fataler than scurvy.  I'll
go aft and report it.'
</p>

<p>
He reported it to Mr. Seleucus Thoms, the
second mate, who came for'ard and roused
the scattered watch below from the deck-house
and t'gallant fo'c'sle.  When all hands were
mustered it was certain that Gribbs was
missing.
</p>

<p>
'This is a terrible catastrophe,' said Seleucus
Thoms, who had a weakness for fine language
derived from his rare Christian name, of which
he was extremely proud; 'my name is not
Seleucus Thoms if he hasn't gone overboard.'
</p>

<p>
''E was most rampagious with laughter in
the second dog-watch, sir,' put in old Brooks.
'And 'e talked of green fields, the which I 've
'eard is a werry fatal symptom of calentoor.'
</p>

<p>
'Humph,' said Mr. Thoms, 'there's something
in that.'
</p>

<p>
And when he went for'ard old Brooks was
'as proud as a dog with two tails.'  Though
he usually spent the second dog-watch daily
in proving that Thoms was no sailor, this
endorsement of his theory flattered him greatly.
</p>

<p>
'I've been mistook in the second,' he said,
as Thoms went aft.  'He's got 'orse sense,
after all.  I shouldn't be surprised if 'e'd <i>make</i>
a sailor some day.'
</p>

<p>
And Thoms reported the catastrophe to Watchett.
</p>

<p>
'Drowned himself,' roared the captain;
'drowned himself.  And who's responsible if you ain't?'
</p>

<p>
He came on deck in a great rage and scanty
pyjamas and mustered the crew aft, and raved
at them for full ten minutes as if it were their
fault.  When he had relieved his mind he asked
if there was any one who could throw light on
the matter, and old Brooks was shoved to the
front.  He explained his views on calentures.
</p>

<p>
'Never 'eard of 'em,' said Watchett.
</p>

<p>
'And I thinks, sir, as Tidewell 'ere 'as the
symptoms.'
</p>

<p>
'I haven't,' said Tidewell indignantly.
</p>

<p>
'Wild laughin' is a known symptom, sir, and
Tidewell was laughin' 'orrid in the second
dog-watch,' insisted Brooks.  'I'd put 'im in irons, sir.'
</p>

<p>
But Watchett was not prepared to go so far
in prophylaxis.
</p>

<p>
'If any of you 'as any more symptoms, I'll
flog 'im and take the consequences,' he declared.
He went below again unhappily, for he wasn't
quite a brute after all.
</p>

<p>
'This is a mighty unpleasant thing,' he said
to poor Mrs. Watchett, who cried when she
heard the news.  'It's a mighty unfortunate
affair.  Gribbs was the smartest man in the
whole crowd, and worth two of the others.'
</p>

<p>
But still the great and terrible calm lasted
and the morning was as hot as yesterday, and
the sea shone like polished brass and lapped
faintly like heavy oil against the glowing iron
of the sister barques.  At dawn, which came up
like a swiftly opening flower out of the fertile
east, the vessels were just too far apart for
hailing, and Watchett signalled the news to
the <i>Star of the South</i>.
</p>

<p>
'Lost a man overboard!' said Ryder, 'that's
strange.  I wish to heavens we'd found him.'
</p>

<p>
When he told his wife she seemed
extraordinarily callous.
</p>

<p>
'Serves him right,' she said.
</p>

<p>
And it was wonderful how the crew of the
<i>Star</i> took the news.  They had never seemed
so cheerful.  They grinned when Watchett
came aboard.
</p>

<p>
'This is an 'orrid circumstance,' said
Watchett.  'I never lost a man before, not
even when I was wrecked in the <i>Violet</i>.  And
this a dead calm!'
</p>

<p>
'Your men aren't happy,' said Mrs. Ryder.
'And you don't try to make 'em.  If I give you
three seven-pound tins of marmalade and some
butter, will you serve it out to them?'
</p>

<p>
But Watchett shook his head angrily.
</p>

<p>
'I'll not cocker no men up,' he declared;
'not if they all goes overboard and leaves me
and the missis to take 'er home.  And what's
marmalade against 'eat like this?'
</p>

<p>
He mopped a melancholy brow and sighed.
</p>

<p>
'It will help them to keep from gloomy
thoughts,' said Mrs. Ryder.  'The <i>Star of the
South</i> is a home for our men.'
</p>

<p>
'And two run in Valparaiso,' retorted
Watchett, 'and I lost on'y one.'
</p>

<p>
He took a drink with his cousin, and went
back on board the <i>Battle-Axe</i>, and put the
horrid day through in getting a deal of
unnecessary work done.  And still no flaw of
lightest air marred the mirror of the quiet seas.
Early in the first watch the boats were lowered
again to tow the vessels apart.  At midnight,
when the watch below came aft and answered to
their names in the deep shadow of the moonless
tropic night, Ned Tidewell did not answer to his name.
</p>

<p>
'Tidewell!' cried Thoms angrily and
anxiously.
</p>

<p>
And still there was no answer but a groan
from old Brooks.
</p>

<p>
'Wot did I tell you?' he demanded.  'I seed
it in 'is eye.'
</p>

<p>
They searched the <i>Battle-Axe</i> from stem to
stern; they overhauled the sails in the
sail-locker; they hunted with a lantern in the
fore-peak; they even went aloft to the fore- and
main-tops, where once or twice some one
who sought for coolness where no coolness
could be found went up into what they jocosely
called the 'attic.'  But Ned had lost the number
of his mess.
</p>

<p>
'More clothes for sale,' said the melancholy
crew, as they looked at each other suspiciously.
''Oo'll be the next?'
</p>

<p>
Brooks declared to the other fo'c'sleman that
the next would be Wat Crampe or Taffy, as they
called the Welshman.
</p>

<p>
'There's an awful 'orrid look of the deep,
dark knowledge o' death in their faces,' declared
old Brooks.  'They thinks of the peace of it
and the quiet, and smiles secret!'
</p>

<p>
Next morning Watchett hailed the <i>Star</i> and
told the latest dreadful news.  And at the end he
added, in a truly pathetic roar: 'Send me them
tins o' marmalade aboard.  And the butter.'
</p>

<p>
And when Mrs. Ryder superintended the
steward's work getting these stores out of the
lazarette, she smiled very strangely.  She said
to her husband&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'If he loses another hand or two the
<i>Battle-Axe</i> will be no easy ship to work, Will.'
</p>

<p>
'I wouldn't have believed the matter of a
hundred pounds would have made you so
hard,' said Ryder.  And Connie Ryder pouted
mutinously, and her pout ran off into a wicked
and most charming smile.
</p>

<p>
'I'm not thinking so much of the money
as of our ship being beaten,' she said.
</p>

<p>
And poor Watchett was now beginning to
think the same of his ship.  Like most vessels
the <i>Battle-Axe</i> required a certain number of
men to work her easily, and her luck lay in
the number allowed being the number
necessary.  With two hands gone amissing she
would not be much superior to the <i>Star</i> in
easiness of handling, and if more went, a
week of baffling winds now, or later when the
North-East Trade died out, might give the
Star a pull which nothing but an easterly
wind from the chops of the Channel to Dover
could hope to make up.  He began to dance
attendance on his crew as if they were patients
and he their doctor.  And the curious thing
was that they all began to feel ill at once, so
ill that they could not work in the sun.  A
certain uneasy terror got hold of them; they
dreaded to look over the side lest in place of
an oily sea they should look down on grass
and daisies.
</p>

<p>
'Daisies draws a man, and buttercups draws
a man,' said old Brooks.
</p>

<p>
'Don't,' said Crampe with a snigger, 'you
make me feel that I must pick buttercups or die.'
</p>

<p>
'Do you now?' asked Brooks; 'do you now?'
</p>

<p>
And he sneaked aft to the skipper, who was
turning all ways as if he were wondering where
windward was.
</p>

<p>
'I'm very uneasy about Crampe, sir,' he said
with a scrape as he crawled up the port
poop-ladder.  ''Is mind is set on buttercups.'
</p>

<p>
'The devil it is,' cried Watchett, and going
down on the main-deck he called Crampe
out.
</p>

<p>
'What's this I 'ears about you 'ankerin'
after buttercups?' he demanded very anxiously.
</p>

<p>
'I <i>did</i> feel as if I'd like to see one, sir,' said
Crampe.
</p>

<p>
'Don't let me 'ear of it again,' began
Watchett angrily, but he pulled himself up with
an ill grace, 'but there, go in and lie down,
and you needn't come on deck in your watch.
I can't afford to lose no more mad fools.  And
you shall 'ave butter instead of buttercups.'
</p>

<p>
'And marmalade, sir?' suggested Crampe.
'Marmalade is yellow too; yellow as buttercups.'
</p>

<p>
'Say the word agin and I'll knock you flat,'
said the skipper.  But nevertheless he sent
the whole crowd marmalade and butter at four
bells in the first dog-watch.
</p>

<p>
'Ho, but it iss fine,' said 'Efan Efans.'
'Thiss iss goot grup whateffer and moreover,
yess!'
</p>

<p>
'They scoffs the like in the <i>Star</i> day in and
day out,' said Crampe.  'If I can't roll on
grass I'd like to be in her.'
</p>

<p>
And that night both Crampe and Evans
disappeared.
</p>

<p>
'I believes I 'eard a splash soon after six
bells,' said old Brooks.  'Mates, this is most
'orrid.  I feels as if I should be drawed
overboard by a mermaid in spite of myself.'
</p>

<p>
And Watchett went raving crazy.  He
blasphemed his mate till the man was ready to
jump overboard too.  He turned on Thoms
and slanged him until the second greaser
walked to the port rail of the poop and
discharged a number of silent curses which would
have done credit to the skipper of a barge,
if they had been spoken aloud.
</p>

<p>
'At dark, lock the lot up in the fo'c'sle,'
said Watchett, 'and not a soul comes out
till daylight.  If this goes on longer we'll
stick in the doldrums till the Day of Judgment.'
</p>

<p>
Ryder came on board the <i>Battle-Axe</i> as soon
as the latest news was signalled to him.
Mrs. Ryder declined to go, but she gave him a timely
piece of advice.
</p>

<p>
'Don't let him off the bet, Will, or I'll never
forgive you.'
</p>

<p>
'I won't do that,' said her husband hastily,
as if he hadn't been thinking of doing it.
</p>

<p>
'And if he asks for a man or two, you know
we're short-handed already?'
</p>

<p>
'Tell me something I don't know,' said
Ryder a trifle crossly.  Even his sweet temper
suffered in 115° in the shade.
</p>

<p>
'I dare say I could,' said his wife when he
was in his boat.  'I dare say I could.'
</p>

<p>
Watchett received his cousin with an air of
gloom that would have struck a damp on
anything anywhere but the Equator.
</p>

<p>
'This is a terrible business,' he said.  'I
never 'eard of anything like it.  Every night
a man, and last night two!'
</p>

<p>
Ryder was naturally very much cut up about
it, and said so.
</p>

<p>
'Will you have some more marmalade?' he asked anxiously.
</p>

<p>
'Marmalade don't work,' said Watchett
sadly.  'It don't work worth a cent, nor does
butter.  I'd give five pounds for some green cabbage.'
</p>

<p>
A brilliant idea struck Ryder.
</p>

<p>
'Why don't you paint her green, all the
inside of the rail and the boats?'
</p>

<p>
'She'd be a holy show, like a blasted
timber-droghing Swede,' said Watchett with great
distaste.  'But d'ye think it'd work?'
</p>

<p>
'You might try,' replied Ryder.
</p>

<p>
'And now you've got the bulge on me,'
sighed Watchett, 'with two 'ands missin' from
both watches she'll be as 'ard in the mouth
as your <i>Star</i>.  You might let me off that bet, Bill.'
</p>

<p>
'No,' said Ryder, 'a bet's a bet.'
</p>

<p>
'But fairness is fairness,' urged Watchett.
'There should be a clause in a bet renderin'
it void by the act of God or the Queen's enemies.'
</p>

<p>
'There isn't,' said his cousin.  'And you
forget you wouldn't help me about those two
hands I wanted.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, if you talk like that&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'That's the way I talk,' said Ryder remembering
the wife he had left behind him.  'I'm sorry.'
</p>

<p>
'Damn your sorrow,' said Watchett.  'But
I'll lose no more, and 'taint your money yet.'
</p>

<p>
'Will you and Mary come on board to tea?'
asked Ryder.
</p>

<p>
'I won't tea with no unfair person with no
sympathy,' returned Watchett savagely.
</p>

<p>
And when Ryder had gone he set the crowd
painting his beautiful white paint a ripe grass
green.
</p>

<p>
'Watch if it soothes 'em any,' he said to
Seleucus Thoms.  'If it seems to work I'll
paint 'er as green as a child's Noah's ark.'
</p>

<p>
And that night there was no decrease of the
<i>Battle-Axe's</i> sad crowd, in spite of the fact that
he did not keep his word and lock them up
in the stuffy fo'c'sle.  For soon after midnight
the mate, Mr. Double, felt one side of his face
cooler than the other as he stood staring at the
motionless lights of the <i>Star of the South</i>, then
lying stern on to the <i>Battle-Axe's</i> starboard
beam.
</p>

<p>
'Eh, what?  Jerusalem!' said Double.  Then
he let a joyous bellow out of him: 'Square
the yards!'
</p>

<p>
For there was a breath of wind out of the
south.  Both vessels were alive in a moment,
and while the <i>Battle-Axe</i> was squaring away
the <i>Star's</i> foreyard was braced sharp up on the
starboard tack till she fell off before the little
breeze.  Then she squared her yards too, and
both vessels moved at least a mile towards
home before they began fooling all round the
compass again.
</p>

<p>
'Them hands missin' makes a difference,'
said Watchett gloomily.  'Less than enough
is starvation.'
</p>

<p>
As they fought through the night for the
flaws of wind which came out of all quarters,
the short watches of the <i>Battle-Axe</i> found
that out and cursed accordingly.  But it was
a very curious thing that the <i>Star of the South</i>
was never so easy to handle.
</p>

<p>
'That foreyard goes round now,' said old
Semple, 'as if it was hung like a balance.
This is very surprising so it is.'
</p>

<p>
He mentioned the remarkable fact to M'Gill
when he came on deck at four in the morning,
and so long as it was dark, as it was till nearly
six, M'Gill found it so too.  And both watches
were in a surprisingly good temper.  For
nothing tries men so much as 'brace up' and
'square away' every five minutes as they work
their ship through a belt of calm.  But as soon
as the sun was up the <i>Star</i> worked just as badly
as she did before.
</p>

<p>
'It's maist amazin',' said M'Gill.
</p>

<p>
During the day the calm renewed itself and
gave every one a rest.  But once more the
breeze came at night, and the amazing easiness
of the <i>Star</i> showed itself when the darkness
fell across the sea.  Ryder and Semple and
M'Gill were full of wonder and delight.
</p>

<p>
'The character of a ship will change sometimes,'
said Semple.  'It's just like a collision
that will alter her deviation.  This calm has
worked a revolution.'
</p>

<p>
Because of this revolution the <i>Star</i> got ahead
of the <i>Battle-Axe</i> every change and chance of
the wind.  She got ahead with such effect that
on the third day the <i>Battle-Axe</i> was hull down
to the south'ard, and when the fourth dawn
broke she was out of sight.  This meant much
more than may appear, for the <i>Star</i> picked up
the North-East Trade nearly four days earlier
than her rival, and a better Trade at that; for
when the <i>Battle-Axe</i> crawled into its area it
was half-sister to a calm, while the <i>Star</i> was
doing eight knots an hour.  And as there was
now no need to touch tack or sheet, there
was no solution of the mysterious ease with
which she worked in the dark.  How long the
mystery might have remained such no one
can say, but it was owing to Mrs. Ryder's
curious behaviour that it came out.  She
laughed in the strangest manner till Ryder
got quite nervous.
</p>

<p>
'Those chaps that jumped overboard from
the <i>Battle-Axe</i> laughed like that,' he told her
in great anxiety.
</p>

<p>
And she giggled more and more.
</p>

<p>
'Shall I try marmalade?' she asked.  Then
she sat down by him and went off into something
so like hysterics that a mere man might
be excused for thinking she was crazy.
</p>

<p>
'They're not dead,' she cried, 'they're not
dead!'
</p>

<p>
'Who aren't dead?' asked her husband
desperately.  And remembering something
which had been told him years before, he
took her hands and slapped with such severity
that she screamed and then cried, and finally
put her head upon his shoulder and confessed.
</p>

<p>
'Was it mutiny of me to do it?' she asked penitently.
</p>

<p>
Will Ryder tried to look severe, and then
laughed until he cried.  'Whatever made you
think of it?'
</p>

<p>
'It wasn't a what, it was a who,' said his
wife; 'it was Silas Bagge.'
</p>

<p>
'The devil it was,' said Will, and with that
he went on deck.
</p>

<p>
'Call all hands, and let them muster aft,' he
said to M'Gill, who, much wondering, did what
he was told.  The watch on deck dropped their
jobs, and the watch below turned out.
</p>

<p>
'Call the names over,' said Ryder sternly.
</p>

<p>
'They're all here, sir,' said M'Gill.
</p>

<p>
The skipper looked down at the upturned
faces of the men and singled out Silas Bagge
as if he meant to speak to him.  But he checked
himself, and going down on the main deck,
walked for'ard to the fo'c'sle.  The men turned
to look after him, and there was a grin on
every face which would have been ample for
two.  Ryder walked quickly, and pushing aside
the canvas door he came on a party playing
poker.  He heard strange voices.
</p>

<p>
'I go one petter, moreover,' said one of them.
</p>

<p>
'I see you, and go two better,' said a man
with a Newcastle burr in his speech.
</p>

<p>
Then Ryder took a hand.
</p>

<p>
'And I see you,' he remarked.  They dropped
their cards and jumped to their feet.
</p>

<p>
'What are you doing here?' he demanded.
And there wasn't a word from one of them:
they looked as sheepish as four stowaways
interviewing the skipper before a crowd of passengers.
</p>

<p>
'Get on deck,' said Ryder.  And much to
M'Gill's astonishment, the addition to the crew
appeared with the captain behind them.
</p>

<p>
'Divide this lot among the watches,' said Ryder.
</p>

<p>
Leaving M'Gill 'to tumble to the racket,'
he walked to the mate's berth and explained
to him that henceforth the <i>Star of the South</i>
would go about as easy by day as by night.
</p>

<p>
'Then they're not dead?' cried Semple.
</p>

<p>
'Not by a jugful,' said Ryder, nodding.
</p>

<p>
'This is very lucky, sir,' said the mate,
smiling.
</p>

<p>
'It's devilish irregular too,' replied the
skipper, as he rubbed his chin.  'Are you
sure you knew nothing of it, Mr. Semple?'
</p>

<p>
'Me, sir?  Why, I'd look on it as mutiny,'
said Semple, 'rank mutiny!'
</p>

<p>
'It was Mrs. Ryder's notion, Semple.'
</p>

<p>
'You don't say so, sir!  She's a woman to
be proud of.'
</p>

<p>
'So she is,' replied Ryder, 'so she is.'
</p>

<p>
He went back to his wife.
</p>

<p>
'You'll win the hundred pounds now, Will?'
</p>

<p>
'I believe I shall,' said Ryder.
</p>

<p>
'And I'll spend it,' cried his wife, coming
to him and kissing him.
</p>

<p>
'I believe you will,' said Ryder.
</p>

<p>
It was a happy ship.

<h3>
THE COMEDY OF THE <i>ORIANA</i>
</h3>

<p>
If the <i>Oriana</i> of Liverpool was a comfortable
ship, and every one who was in her said so,
Captain Joseph Ticehurst was no fool.  He
worked his 'crowd' reasonably, but saw that
they did work; and if any of them shirked or
malingered, the result was unpleasant for the
one who tried such a game on with the quiet
and gentlemanly skipper.  And his mates took
their time from him.
</p>

<p>
'To put it on no higher level,' said Captain
Ticehurst, 'it pays to make a ship comfortable
when she visits the Pacific coast of North
America.  For as things are now, if we lose
the crew in Portland, we shall have to pay
the boarding-house masters at least a hundred
and fifty dollars a man.  And as like as not
every man we took will be worth two and a
half dollars at the most.  I know the Pacific,
and you don't.'
</p>

<p>
For both his mate and second mate were
with him for the first time.
</p>

<p>
'Is that the "blood-money" one hears of,
sir?' asked Mr. Gregg, the second 'greaser.'
</p>

<p>
'That's it,' said Ticehurst, 'and last voyage
I had to pay a hundred dollars each for six
men to Healy the boarding-house master.  And
I own I lost my temper.  I swore I'd never
do it again.  And Healy grinned in my face,
and said that he'd see I paid more next time.
The scoundrel seems to have the whole city
in his hands, and half the newspapers.  Oh,
I tell you the Pacific coast is an eye-opener
to a man who has never been on it, I tell you
that.'
</p>

<p>
The <i>Oriana</i> was then running north, with
a fine south-westerly breeze.  The coast of
Oregon showed up clearly.  With good glasses
it was possible to see Mount Shasta on the
starboard quarter.  Its snows gleamed in the
westering sun; and to the north was the range
of the Siskyous.
</p>

<p>
'We shall be off the mouth of the Columbia
by noon to-morrow with any luck, and if the
breeze holds,' said Ticehurst to himself.  'And
in the morning, I'll have a talk to the men.
If I could only knock a little sense into a
sailor, I'd try to do it.  As one can't, I'll try
talk.'
</p>

<p>
He leant his back against the weather-rail,
and took a broad view of Oregon.
</p>

<p>
'"Different ship, different fash," as the
Dutchman said when he went aft to haul down the
jib,' thought the captain, 'and it's the same
with countries.  I know I'm in for trouble
with my friend Healy.  He'll move heaven
and earth and the other place to get the men
out of my ship.  I'll fight him to a finish this
time; and rather than pay him for men, I'll
take her to sea by myself and drift her
home.'
</p>

<p>
He rubbed his smoothly-shaven chin and
took a thoughtful pull at his port whiskers,
as if he were checking in the weather
braces.
</p>

<p>
'After all, the men would be crazy to quit;
there's hardly one of them with less than fifteen
pounds to take.  I think I see how to manage
it.  I'll try anyhow.'
</p>

<p>
That night he had a long talk with the
mate.  He astonished Mr. Williams considerably.
For Williams by nature belonged to the
school which considers a sailor in the light
of a punching-bag.  It had required one or
two private interviews with his skipper to
induce him to relinquish practices to which
he was wedded.
</p>

<p>
'Well, sir, this is a revolution,' he declared
rather glumly.
</p>

<p>
'I'm a radical,' said Ticehurst, 'and believe
in revolutions when required.  I'll speak to
the men to-morrow when they've had their
breakfast.  I'm no believer in coddling men,
Mr. Williams, but if I have to ask you and
Mr. Gregg to carry them hot shaving-water
every morning while we are in Portland River,
in order to do this Healy, I shall expect you
to carry it.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, very well, sir,' said Williams, and he
retired to his cabin in some dudgeon.
</p>

<p>
'It's the principle I'm thinkin' of,' he
declared, as he turned in.
</p>

<p>
The principle he believed in was that sailors
should expect nothing, and that he was to
see they got it.  His prejudices broke through
his discretion when he turned out at midnight
to take the middle watch.
</p>

<p>
'Has the old man bin letten' you into his
sailor-cockerin' scheme for doin' this Healy in
the eye?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
'No,' replied Gregg.
</p>

<p>
'His notion is to feed 'em on the fat of
Oregon, and give them hot whisky and water
before they turn in.  And you and I have got
to tuck the dears up, and bring them
shavin'-water in the mornin'!'
</p>

<p>
'Who are you getting at?' asked the
incredulous second greaser.
</p>

<p>
'You'll see,' said the mate, 'it's as near that
as a toucher.  And there'll be a dance on
board every night, and private theatricals every
other day, and every day Sunday with no work
in between.'
</p>

<p>
And though his imagination did run away
with him, the skipper's notions as he expounded
them to the assembled crowd next morning
were certainly novel.
</p>

<p>
'I've sent for you, men, to tell you that
to-night we shall be in Portland River,' he began.
</p>

<p>
The men stared at him eagerly.  They
wondered 'what kind of a game was up.'
</p>

<p>
And Ticehurst leant over the rail at the
break of the poop.
</p>

<p>
'How many of you have been in Portland before?'
</p>

<p>
Five men held up their hands.
</p>

<p>
'And how many more in Pacific Coast ports,
such as 'Frisco or Tacoma?'
</p>

<p>
Three more said that they had.  The skipper nodded.
</p>

<p>
'I want to know how many of you left your
ships there.  Speak up and tell the truth.'
</p>

<p>
The eight men shuffled about a bit, and
finally a seaman called Jacobs opened his mouth.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Jacobs?' said Ticehurst.
</p>

<p>
'I reckon we all, more or less, skipped out,
sir,' said Jacobs.  And no one contradicted him.
</p>

<p>
'I thought so,' said the skipper.  'And I'll
tell you what happened.  You left a ship and
left from ten to twenty pounds behind, and you
went to Healy's or to Sant's at Tacoma, and
were drunk on bad liquor for a week, and
then found yourselves without any clothes to
speak of in a homeward-bounder, with an
advance of thirty dollars to work out, didn't you?'
</p>

<p>
'That's about it, sir,' said the shamefaced Jacobs.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, sir,' said the rest.
</p>

<p>
'And when you got home you had two
months' pay or thereabouts to draw, less what
you paid for clothes out of the slop chest.  That
is, you spent six months at sea and a week
ashore for about ten pounds and a bad
headache.  Whereas if you had stayed by your
ships you might have saved yourselves the
headache, saved your clothes, and have got
back to England with a pay-day of twenty
pounds.  Jacobs, what is the worst kind of a
fool you know?'
</p>

<p>
And Jacobs answered promptly&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'If you please, sir, it's a sailor.'
</p>

<p>
'I don't say that it is always your fault if
you desert,' went on Ticehurst, after he had
drawn the reply which was the moral of his
tale.  'I know some of you may have been
run out of your ships; and I know that some
captains are too careful about giving the men
any of the money due to them.  But this is
a comfortable ship.'
</p>

<p>
'It is,' said the men with a unanimous hum.
</p>

<p>
'And I propose to keep it so,' said the 'old
man.'  'And what I want is to keep you on
board.  I'm going to take no precautions
against your skipping, I'm going to treat you
like men.  I'm going to allow you a pound
a week each out of your wages for the month
we shall be in Portland, and at six o'clock every
man-jack of you not absolutely required can
go ashore and stay ashore all night so long
as you turn up in the morning.'
</p>

<p>
This was Williams's revolution.  The mate
gave a disgusted grunt and walked away to
the lee rail.  But the men raised a cheer.  The
skipper lifted his hand.
</p>

<p>
'I know this is going a long way beyond
the custom of any ship,' he said, 'and I don't
mind owning I'm doing it, partly to prevent
the biggest boarding-house master in Portland
getting hold of you.  It's true that so far as
I've worked it out your staying by the ship will
save the owners in wages about five pounds a
man.  But that's not the reason I'm doing it.
I'm on this lay because I shall have to pay
Healy' (muffled groans from the men) 'a
hundred and fifty dollars a head for every
fresh man I ship.  I had a row with him last
voyage, and don't propose to put money in his
pocket again.  And if he gets so much from
me, as you know, he'll get your advance note
besides.  Think it over.  That'll do.'
</p>

<p>
And the watch below went forward.
</p>

<p>
'The old man talks sense,' said Jacobs.
'And as for Healy, he's a most notorious
daylight robber, as lives on sailor-men and the
p'isonin' of 'em.  I stayed in 'is 'ouse for ten
days, and was 'oofed, fair 'oofed, on board of
a most notorious American ship where we lived
on belayin' pin soup, and was tickled with
'and-spikes, tickled just to death.  I'll stay by the
old hooker.  What d' ye say, mates?'
</p>

<p>
And they all swore that no enticements
should prevent their sticking to the most
comfortable ship that sailed the seas.  A little after
noon they picked up the pilot, and in a couple
of hours were towing up the Columbia past
Astoria.  And word went on the wires to Portland
that the <i>Oriana</i>, Captain Ticehurst, was
on her way to the Willammette.
</p>

<p>
'That's all right,' said Mr. Healy.  'Now
we'll see!'
</p>

<p>
He gritted his teeth, twisted his ugly mouth,
and gave a nod sideways as if he were bidding
farewell to the finally discomfited skipper of
the <i>Oriana</i>.  For Ticehurst so far had been
the only man with sufficient 'sand' in his
composition to buck up against the most
outrageous system of crimping and extortion
which exists in any part of the world.  San
Francisco (called ''Frisco' by those who have
not lived there) might be tough, and so might
Shanghai Smith, whose name was cursed on
all the seven seas, but Portland, O., the big
wheat port in the smooth and deep Willammette,
with mighty Mount Hood in the background,
was the hardest and toughest and
roughest city in the West.  And Mr. Healy,
Jim Healy, the sandy-headed Irish-American
to whose native brutality a certain low cunning
in diplomacy was added, stood out in blackguardism
and general toughness far above his peers.
</p>

<p>
'We'll see,' said Healy.  'This will be a
skin game, a real freeze-out.  Bully for you,
Mr. Ticehurst!'
</p>

<p>
He called a quiet informal meeting of the
genial blood-suckers who regulate the price of
sailors in a so-called civilised city; and the
crimps assembled in his back parlour, where
many scoundrelly schemes had been hatched.
</p>

<p>
'He's come to fight,' said Healy, 'and what
I propose is to give him so much of it that he'll
sicken and quit.  The first thing right now is
to put prices up.  I vote we make it a hundred
and sixty dollars a man.'
</p>

<p>
He proposed to charge the skipper of any
merchant ship £32 a head for any man he
shipped.  He also proposed to take the entire
<i>Oriana's</i> crew out of her, in which case he
would have to supply eighteen men all told,
when she was full of wheat and ready to sail.
In other words, it was his idea, and on such
ideas he lived, to charge £576 for a crew.
And as men were scarce, they must of
necessity be drawn from another ship, to which
the crew of the <i>Oriana</i> would presently be
sold.  It was a great scheme, and much
honour must assuredly be given to the men
who originated so easy a manner of getting a
living.  It amounted to charging two
shipmasters a fee of £1152 for swapping crews.
This is the way the crimps of Portland live
even unto this day, in the year of civilisation
1901.  There are pickings besides, for as John
Jacobs, A.B. in the <i>Oriana</i>, had said when
his skipper asked him who was the biggest
kind of a fool, 'If you please, sir, it's a sailor.'  On
consideration, however, it might appear that
the State of Oregon, which allowed its trade
to be hampered by such means, was collectively
even a bigger fool than a sailor.
</p>

<p>
The proposal of the one hundred and sixty
dollars price was carried unanimously.  And
Healy grinned sardonically as he spoke further
to his friends.
</p>

<p>
'Last time this Ticehurst and me came
mighty close to trouble, and I want to get
even.  And I mean to be.  Now what I want
is this.  Any men you boys get off of her I
want transferred to me.  When I ship them
I'll settle with you.  And, moreover, if he
comes to you for men, send him on to me.
I'll talk to him, the low down swine!  I'll
talk to him like a father!'
</p>

<p>
The prospect of speaking to Ticehurst like
a father fairly made him purr with joy.  A
pretty thing, was it not, to have one's honest
business broken up by any infernal Englishman!
He had a talk with his runner and laid
his plans.
</p>

<p>
'Mebbe he'll give us trouble, but I rely on
you, Tom,' said Jim Healy.  'Get 'em away
at any price.  Load 'em up with the best
liquor.  And give 'em as much pocket-money
as they wants.  All I ask is to get 'em.'
</p>

<p>
And Tom Gilson, who had a name for
persuasion which would have made the reputation
of a lawyer, stuck his tongue in his cheek.
</p>

<p>
'When did I fail?' asked Tom.
</p>

<p>
And when he went down to the wharf,
he found to his utter surprise that Ticehurst
greeted him quite amicably.
</p>

<p>
'You're Mr. Healy's runner, aren't you?'
</p>

<p>
'I am, sir,' said Tom.
</p>

<p>
'Please go on board my ship,' said the
skipper.  'Have a look round.  Where are
your other friends?  Oh, here they come.
Now this is nice and kind of them.'
</p>

<p>
He greeted the runners from the other houses
with equal cordiality and invited them on board.
It was then almost six.  When four bells struck
Ticehurst told Williams to knock the men off.
As soon as they were in the fo'c'sle Ticehurst
went to the starboard door and called to Jacobs.
</p>

<p>
'Jacobs!'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, sir,' said Jacobs, coming out in a hurry.
</p>

<p>
The skipper pointed to the runners.
</p>

<p>
'These gentlemen have come down to see
you,' said the captain.  'They are runners all
of them, and want you to leave this ship in
order to put money into their pockets and the
pockets of Mr. Healy.  They have another
ship for you in about a week, probably a nice
American ship.  Don't forget what I said, and
when you are ready come aft for some money.
Good day, gentlemen.  My compliments to Mr. Healy.'
</p>

<p>
'Damme, the old man is luny,' said Williams.
'If I had my way I'd have her boomed off into
the stream and I'd kick the runners overboard.'
</p>

<p>
But with such methods Tom and his friends
were familiar.  The new tactics of the <i>Oriana's</i>
skipper took them all aback.  They stood close
together and stared at each other.
</p>

<p>
'Say, what sort of a game is he playin'?'
they asked each other.
</p>

<p>
'The derned ratty old hoosier,' said Tom;
'he's tryin' to go to windward of us at the
start.  This is quite a new thing, this is.  The
old galoot has been goin' in for bein' popular
with his crowd.  But if I know sailors, it won't work.'
</p>

<p>
He started for the fo'c'sle and put his head in.
</p>

<p>
'What cheer boys, and how goes it?  What
kind of a passage did you have?'
</p>

<p>
'Long, but easy,' said Jacobs coolly, as he
pulled on a guernsey over his head.  'No work
to speak of and fine weather.'
</p>

<p>
The other runners gathered round their prey.
Grant's man went inside and sat down.  He
produced a bottle.
</p>

<p>
'Will you have a nip?'
</p>

<p>
'Just had a tot,' said Jacobs.  'The old man
sarved it out when we came in sight of the city.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, who's for the shore, boys?' put in
Tom Gilson.  'You'll be ready for a good
time now, and Portland is a daisy of a place,
I tell you.  The best of grub and good
liquor, and the prettiest gals running around
here.  Who's with me for Healy's?  He gets
up the best table in the city, and I don't care
who sets up the next best.'
</p>

<p>
The second mate came for'ard.
</p>

<p>
'The captain is ready with your money, men.'
</p>

<p>
'Is he goin' to pay you off?' asked the
runners.
</p>

<p>
'Lord bless you, no,' said Hillyer, who was
Jacobs's chum.  'He's only ladling it out in
easy goes just to let us have some fun here.
Five dollars a week; think of that!'
</p>

<p>
It was certainly unusual, and the runners stared.
</p>

<p>
'Five dollars,' sneered Gilson.  'Why,
every man of you that comes ashore with me
shall have ten right off.'
</p>

<p>
'And a ship next week,' said Jacobs drily.
'I know; I've been there.  I was in Portland
and in your house, mister, three years ago.'
</p>

<p>
'But I wasn't here then, and things are
changed.  Sailors have it all their own way
now, and we guarantee a month ashore and
thirty dollars a month when you ship.'
</p>

<p>
Talk as he would, and he did talk, he had
struck a crowd that for a time would have
nothing to say to him.  They were quiet and
sober, and knew, in American parlance, that he
was not on board the <i>Oriana</i> for his health.
He was there for dollars.  The men went
aft one by one and the skipper talked to
them.
</p>

<p>
'We shan't turn to till eight in the morning,'
he said, 'and don't forget that the men I've let
on board are not here for your good, it's for
their own.  Here's a dollar for you.  I've
made up my mind to let you have a dollar a
night.  If you sleep on board, it will be all the
better for you.'
</p>

<p>
And the men went out feeling that for once
they had a captain who understood men a little.
There was not one of them who did not make
up his mind to keep sober and stay by the
<i>Oriana</i>.  And as a crew is a crowd, and with the
obstinate affections of a crowd, the initial
direction given to their thoughts persisted long.
The runners were given the cold shoulder, and
every suggestion they made was looked on as
a trap.  The men followed Jacobs and Hillyer,
who both had some knowledge of Portland.
</p>

<p>
'It's my belief this will work,' said Ticehurst,
as he watched them go.
</p>

<p>
'Well, sir, if you find half of them here in
the morning, I'll eat a cat-block,' said the mate.
</p>

<p>
'We'll see,' replied Ticehurst.  And he
interviewed the steward.  'While we're here,' he
said, 'the men are to get soft bread and fresh
meat and vegetables three times a day.  If it
costs what it will, it will be money in the
owner's pockets.'
</p>

<p>
He went ashore himself, and found his way
to the house of the British consul, whom he
knew pretty well, for it was too late to go to the
agents.  Mr. Sedgwick was a bright man and
sturdy, but he was rather pessimistic over the
<i>Oriana's</i> prospects.
</p>

<p>
'This Healy is cunning as well as mean and
venal and brutal,' he said, 'I know he has
it laid up for you.  Don't have anything to do
with him personally.  The law here is pretty
much what it is made by the people who want
to use it to make money.  He'll bribe your
men off.'
</p>

<p>
'I'll have them arrested,' said Ticehurst.
</p>

<p>
Sedgwick shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
'They'll have to be found.  And judging by
what happened to the <i>Heather Bell</i>, if the
United States put them on board, the State
of Oregon will take them off.  There are
two sets of laws here, and State law has
the pull.  And Healy has the pull on
the State law as administered by elected
judges.'
</p>

<p>
'We'll see,' said Ticehurst, who thought he
knew a little.  He was about to learn more.
'We'll see.'
</p>

<p>
'So you will,' said the consul.
</p>

<p>
'At any rate, four of my men are teetotalers,'
said Ticehurst, 'and some of those who are
not are not quite such fools as most sailors.  I
believe I've fixed Healy this time.'
</p>

<p>
But in the morning he was four men short,
and the comedy began.
</p>

<p>
Yet Ticehurst did not lose his temper.  He
was as cool as the top of Mount Hood to the
eastward.
</p>

<p>
'Work the men easy, Mr. Williams,' he
said, 'work 'em easy.  Just keep 'em going.
Remember this is going to be a game, and the
counters are men.  A hard word may spoil
me, and I want you to be popular.  Do you
understand?'
</p>

<p>
The mate sighed.
</p>

<p>
'To be sure, to be sure, sir, if you desire it.'
</p>

<p>
And the skipper went to see Mr. Sedgwick
again.
</p>

<p>
'Sedgwick, I lost four men last night.'
</p>

<p>
'The devil you did!'
</p>

<p>
'So Healy scores first blood.  What's to be
my next move?'
</p>

<p>
'Then you mean to fight?'
</p>

<p>
'By the Lord, I do.  And I want your help,
if it's only to make such a row that the Board
of Trade at home will hear of it.'
</p>

<p>
And Sedgwick said he'd do his best.
</p>

<p>
'Nevertheless&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
And he sighed, like the mate, though for
different reasons.  Together they went up-town
and found the United States Marshal.
</p>

<p>
'You want a warrant to get the four
arrested?' asked the marshal; 'and you shall
have it.  But you know the game they'll play?'
</p>

<p>
Sedgwick did, and Ticehurst didn't.
</p>

<p>
'They'll work the State of Oregon against
me,' said the marshal, 'and it'll be a fight.'
</p>

<p>
'That's what I'm here for,' said the skipper
of the <i>Oriana</i>.  He quoted General Grant:
"I'll fight it out in this line if it takes all the
summer."  How is it you let Healy and his
gang run the port?'
</p>

<p>
'I can't help it,' replied the official of the
United States.  'I don't think you Englishmen
understand that being a United States official
here is pretty much the same as being a
foreigner.  There's folks here that would rather
do me up than drink.  However, we'll get the
warrant and arrest these men to-night, if they
can be found.'
</p>

<p>
They tried to arrest them that night.  And
Healy got word, of course, about what was
coming.
</p>

<p>
'All right,' said Healy.  'I'll fix you.'
</p>

<p>
He sent for Gilson.
</p>

<p>
'Take these men back to the <i>Oriana</i>!'
</p>

<p>
'Eh, what?' said Gilson, 'are you going to
quit already?'
</p>

<p>
'Roll up a blanket or two of mine with their
dunnage, you fool,' said Healy.
</p>

<p>
And the runner laughed.
</p>

<p>
'Well, you are a daisy.'
</p>

<p>
And when the marshal appeared, Healy interviewed him.
</p>

<p>
'Come right in and look for 'em.  They're
not here.'
</p>

<p>
And, of course, they weren't.
</p>

<p>
'They're back on their ship,' said Healy,
with a grin.
</p>

<p>
'And what's your game?' asked the marshal.
</p>

<p>
'You'll know to-morrow,' said the boarding-house
keeper, and the marshal went down to
the <i>Oriana</i> to see Ticehurst.
</p>

<p>
'They came on board and swore they never
meant to desert,' said Ticehurst; 'what's the
meaning of it?'
</p>

<p>
'We'll have to wait.'
</p>

<p>
But they knew in the morning when the
police of the State of Oregon came down on
board.
</p>

<p>
'Well, what do you want?' asked Williams.
</p>

<p>
He knew when the four men were arrested
for stealing blankets from Healy's house.  They
were taken away and clapped in gaol.
</p>

<p>
'By the Lord, this is a game,' said Ticehurst.
'That's a point to Healy.'
</p>

<p>
He went to Sedgwick and told him about
the new move, and Sedgwick nodded.
</p>

<p>
'What he doesn't know isn't worth knowing.
I'll come down to the court with you.'
</p>

<p>
And the judge, who happened not to be one
of those in Healy's pocket, saw through the
game when Ticehurst took the witness-stand.
</p>

<p>
'This is a conflict between me and Mr. Healy,'
said Ticehurst; 'and I don't believe the
men stole the blankets.'
</p>

<p>
'We didn't,' said the men unanimously.
They looked very sorry for themselves.  And
Justice Smith smiled as he fined them twenty-five
dollars.  Smith said that he was inclined to
be lenient, and later in the afternoon he remitted
the fine on condition the men went on board.
They agreed to this very humbly.
</p>

<p>
'Well, we score,' said Ticehurst.
</p>

<p>
Sedgwick shook his head.
</p>

<p>
'It's not over yet.'
</p>

<p>
And so it proved, for Ticehurst met Healy in
Main Street that evening.
</p>

<p>
'You think you've bested me,' said Healy,
'but you haven't.  Nor you can't say you have
till you get to sea with your men.'
</p>

<p>
'There seems some law to be had here after
all, Mr. Healy,' replied Ticehurst.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Smith's no good.  We'll have him
out,' said Healy; 'if these judges won't do as
we want them, we'll have others that will.'
</p>

<p>
He cocked his hat and marched on.
</p>

<p>
'By Jove!' said Ticehurst.  'I wonder now!'
</p>

<p>
He went after the boarding-house keeper.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Mr. Healy!'
</p>

<p>
Healy turned round scowling.
</p>

<p>
'Let's fight fair,' said Ticehurst.  'I'd like
to know if you consider this conversation
private?'
</p>

<p>
'Private be damned,' said Healy, 'it's what
you like.'
</p>

<p>
And Ticehurst smiled.
</p>

<p>
'I think I'll fix him,' he said.
</p>

<p>
But Healy grinned.  He grinned more widely
than ever when Ticehurst's letter in the Sunday
Oregonian gave the whole conversation between
himself and Healy.  This was followed up
next day by an interview in which Ticehurst
expressed much more astonishment than he
felt at the ways of Pacific Coast ports.  One
would have thought him quite a child in such matters.
</p>

<p>
But even Ticehurst, who had not consulted
Sedgwick, was a little surprised the following
morning.  He was arrested by the deputy-sheriff
at ten o'clock.
</p>

<p>
'It's for libel,' said the police officer.  And
he read the warrant.
</p>

<p>
The information on which the warrant of
arrest was issued read most cheerfully&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'The said John Doe Ticehurst, on the 16th
day of August 1899, in the City of Portland,
County of Multnomah, State of Oregon, then
and there being, did then and there maliciously
and feloniously, by means other than words
orally spoken, cause to be published of and
concerning another, to wit John Healy, certain
false and scandalous matter in the <i>Sunday
Oregonian</i>, to wit "If we can't get these judges
to do as we want, we will have judges that
will," with intent then and there to injure and
defame the said John Healy.'
</p>

<p>
'You'll come right along to Justice Hayne's
Court, east side,' said the deputy-sheriff.
</p>

<p>
He was let out again at eleven o'clock on
'putting up' five hundred dollars cash bail.
</p>

<p>
'I reckon I've got him,' said Healy chuckling.
'We'll tie his old hooker up, and she
getting ready for sea again, and we'll get the
whole crowd out of her.'
</p>

<p>
'I have been coming to the conclusion of
late years that going to sea was tolerably dull,'
said Ticehurst to Sedgwick, as they walked
through the crowd of loafers outside Hayne's
Court.  'But Portland is not dull.'
</p>

<p>
'Even I don't find it so,' said the consul.
'But, of course, this is to keep you here.
You're nearly ready for sea?'
</p>

<p>
'I shall be in three days.'
</p>

<p>
'And your crew?'
</p>

<p>
So far I've got them all.'
</p>

<p>
Sedgwick shook his head.
</p>

<p>
'They'd rather die than let you go like that.
How in thunder have you kept them?'
</p>

<p>
And Ticehurst explained his wonderful theory.
</p>

<p>
'I've really tried to make them comfortable,
and I've treated them like men.  I give them
all they earn while they're in port.  But what
am I to do?'
</p>

<p>
'I'll think of it,' said Sedgwick.
</p>

<p>
He thought to some purpose.  For it was
commonly stated in Portland that many
masters of merchant ships paid the boarding-house
masters to induce the men to desert,
when the amount of wages due to them from
the ship was more than the 'blood-money'
which had to be paid for a new crew.
</p>

<p>
'I think that's the line,' said Sedgwick.  He
got a reporter to go and interview Mr. Healy,
and Healy being more than half-seas over and
in high delight at having held up Ticehurst
and the <i>Oriana</i>, let himself go.
</p>

<p>
'Curse the lot of 'em,' said Healy; 'they talk
as if a boarding-house master was necessary
a scoundrel.  Ay, they do, and there's them
lying in the <i>Willammette</i> now as have come
to me winking the eye, and saying, "Now,
Mr. Healy, how much do you want to take my crew
out of my ship?"  Why, I've done it as low
as ten dollars a head, and have had a hundred
a head for putting a new crowd in, and then
it's been money in the pockets of the ship-owners
and the captain, as it stands to reason
it would be if the ship owed the men more than
a hundred and ten dollars, besides saving the
grub for a time when the men are doing little.'
</p>

<p>
'But Ticehurst didn't do this?'
</p>

<p>
Healy smiled and was incautious.
</p>

<p>
'To be sure he didn't.  But he would if it
paid him.  If he'd come in here after a long
voyage instead of a short passage out from
Liverpool, he'd have been in my back room
with dollars.'
</p>

<p>
And next day this was in the papers.  Sedgwick
smiled and ran down to see Ticehurst,
whose ship was lying in the stream with a
United States marshal in charge of her to see
the men stayed on board and were not taken off
by Healy's pirates, and a Multnomah county
official to see that Ticehurst stayed more or less
in sight.
</p>

<p>
'Now,' said Ticehurst, 'haven't I got him?'
</p>

<p>
'You can try,' said Sedgwick.
</p>

<p>
So Ticehurst filed a complaint in the United
States Circuit Court in 'a damage suit' against
Healy, laying his damages at ten thousand dollars.
</p>

<p>
'It will make him sick,' said Sedgwick.
And it did.
</p>

<p>
Healy fairly howled, and by way of immediate
revenge sent one of his ruffians to catch
the reporter who had caught him.
</p>

<p>
'Sock it to him good, Joe,' said Healy;
'don't leave him a feather to fly with.  Stamp
on his right hand and kick his ribs in.  I'll
teach him to come down here with a pencil and a
note-book and lay traps for inoffending citizens,
so I will.'
</p>

<p>
And Joe went off to 'do up' the reporter.
As it happened (and it was unlucky for Joe) the
reporter was a man of his hands, and not at all
an unsuspecting person.  It was Joe who went
to the hospital, and not the man with the pencil
and the note-book.  Nevertheless, as he
understood how things shaped themselves in Oregon
and in Pacific ports generally, this particular
reporter thought it healthy to go elsewhere.
What Joe had failed in Jack might do, and
Healy had a very long memory, as many
injured men could tell.
</p>

<p>
'What I like about Oregon is its climate and
its general uncertainty,' said Ticehurst.  'It
makes me feel young again.  Of course, I shan't
push this libel suit, Sedgwick.'
</p>

<p>
'If you do, you'll be like Vanderdecken when
it's finished,' said Sedgwick.  'To try to beat
to the westward of the Cape Horn of Law here
will make an ancient Flying Dutchman of you.
I'd try to get to sea.'
</p>

<p>
'I'm going to try,' replied Ticehurst.  'It
will be quite enough of a victory for me to have
come into Portland and go out with the same
men I brought in.'
</p>

<p>
'It's never been done yet,' said Sedgwick,
'and if you get through you'll make a record.'
</p>

<p>
And the next day Ticehurst shifted his quarters
from the ship to the Oregon Hotel in the
city.  He explained that he did so because he
understood it would take some time to finish
the cross suits then in progress.
</p>

<p>
'The man's a fool,' said Healy, rejoicing.
'We'll keep the <i>Oriana</i> here till she goes to
pieces like a rotten scow on a mud-bank.'
</p>

<p>
But Ticehurst was no fool.  He sent the
<i>Oriana</i> down to Astoria to wait until the suits
were done with, and was seen to be much
occupied with legal matters all day long.  At
night he sat in the hall of the hotel and
denounced Healy with much severity.
</p>

<p>
'I'll stay till I get his scalp,' said Ticehurst.
But if he meant what he said it is odd that he
reckoned up what he owed the hotel, and put
the requisite amount of dollars in an otherwise
almost empty portmanteau.  It might also have
seemed strange to Healy if he knew that his
enemy went for a walk late that night and got
as far as St. John's on the railroad to the
north.  There he boarded the last train to
Kalama, that deserted township which once
had a boom of which the bottom fell out, and
went down the Columbia in the <i>Telephone</i>.
</p>

<p>
But Healy tumbled to the whole thing in the
morning when it was found that Ticehurst had
not slept in the hotel.  The Portland authorities,
at Healy's request, went down to Astoria next
day bright and early, and boarded the <i>Oriana</i>.
Mr. Williams, the chief mate, received them at
the gangway.
</p>

<p>
'Where is the captain?'
</p>

<p>
'In Portland,' said Williams sourly.
Treating the men according to Ticehurst's
prescription was getting on his nerves.
</p>

<p>
'He skipped from Portland last night, and
we believe him to be on board,' said the
marshal.
</p>

<p>
'You can look,' said Williams shortly.  If,
as is probable, he knew that Ticehurst was not
in Portland, he also knew he was not on board
the <i>Oriana</i>.  The most careful search failed to
find him.
</p>

<p>
'Why don't you take us alongside and
discharge the wheat,' said Gregg savagely.
'Perhaps he's under two thousand tons
of it.'
</p>

<p>
The second mate was almost as cross as
Williams.  As he said afterwards, the way the
marshal acted, a full-sized English skipper
might be concealed in a sextant case.
</p>

<p>
At last the intruders gave up and went ashore.
</p>

<p>
'You needn't trouble to come on board
again,' said Williams.  'I'm skipper now and
shall take her to sea.'
</p>

<p>
But if that was true it is odd that Ticehurst
was not to be found in Astoria.  He had
disappeared.  The United States Marshal, who
was still on board the <i>Oriana</i>, laughed, for
he had no great sympathy with the state
officials of Oregon.
</p>

<p>
'I guess your skipper has a head,' he opined,
as he lounged against the rail and ejected
tobacco juice into the blue-grey waters of the
great Columbia River.  'Tell me where he is.
I won't give you away.'
</p>

<p>
But even Williams did not know.  He went
to sea next morning, and was towed across the
bar by the tug <i>Comet</i>.  The Oregon people
came on board again and made another search.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, come to sea with me,' said Williams
with a savage eye.  He had a notion that if
they did there would be part of the crew that
Captain Ticehurst would leave at his mercy.
</p>

<p>
'Don't get rowdy, young fellow,' said the
marshal; 'it's a waste of natural energy better
used in learning how to be civil to your superiors.'
</p>

<p>
'But you're licked,' said Williams; 'you're fairly licked.'
</p>

<p>
'Life's a game,' said the state marshal
philosophically, as he went over the side with
his United States rival, 'and if we won always
we should get swelled head.'
</p>

<p>
He looked up from the boat.
</p>

<p>
'Say!' he called.
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' said Williams.
</p>

<p>
'If we're licked, and I own it, where is the captain?'
</p>

<p>
'I'll send word from Europe,' said Williams.
</p>

<p>
But, as a matter of fact, he sent word by
the skipper of the tug.  For it was Captain
Ticehurst who steered the old <i>Comet</i> over the
bar with the <i>Oriana</i> behind.
</p>

<p>
'Now, what I want to know is,' said the
captain to his mate, 'what I want to know is,
whether it isn't better to treat men as men, and
best that crowd in Portland?'
</p>

<p>
Williams looked melancholy.
</p>

<p>
'Well, sir, it may be on a pinch,' he owned;
'but it's the principle I'm thinkin' of.'
</p>

<p>
And his principle was, of course, that
sailor-men were to expect nothing, while his duty
was to see that they got it with any amount
of suitable sauce.

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
